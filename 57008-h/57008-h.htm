<h1 title="">THE HAUNTED HANGAR</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;SUSPICIOUS SANDY&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, all! Engine&rsquo;s quit and left us with
a dead stick! No danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither sixteen-year-old Larry Turner nor
Dick Summers, a year his junior, had any more
fear than had Sandy Maclaren, hardly thirteen
and seated just back of the pilot who, in flying
the four-place, low-wing airplane, had called
back reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff&rsquo;s a war ace and knows his stuff,&rdquo; Larry
mused, &ldquo;and the engine couldn&rsquo;t have died in
a better spot. We are high enough and within
gliding distance of that old, abandoned private
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, who saw something to make light of in
any situation, turned with his plump face
cracked by a broad grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;I always said whether you fly a crate full
of passengers or handle one full of eggs, you
get a good break sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry nodded in his calm, half-serious way.</p>
<p>Only the youngest member of the trio, as the
craft nosed into a gentle glide and banked in
a turn to get in position to shoot the private
landing spot on the old estate, took the occasion
as anything but a lark.</p>
<p>Dick joked, Larry admired the skill of the
pilot.</p>
<p>And Jeff, chewing his gum casually, justified
their confidence.</p>
<p>Sandy Maclaren, with narrowed eyes and an
intent frown, bent his gaze on the pilot&rsquo;s back
and muttered under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That engine didn&rsquo;t die. I saw what Jeff
did. He was as quick as a cat&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t
fool me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His expression altered to a puzzled scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he shut off the ignition and pretend
the engine had stopped&mdash;so handy to this
old, abandoned estate?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>No answer rewarded his agile thoughts as
Jeff skilfully shot the small field, compelled
to come in to one side because of tall trees
directly in their line of flight, over which his
dead engine made it impossible to maneuver.
Nor did he get a solution to his puzzle as Jeff
cleverly side-slipped to lose momentum, and to
get over the neglected, turf-grown runway down
which, a little bumpily but right side up, he
taxied to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jeff said, with a grin, swinging
around in his seat and drawing off his helmet,
&ldquo;here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever get the money to take flying lessons,&rdquo;
Larry said, &ldquo;I know the pilot I&rsquo;m going
to ask to give me instruction! When I can make
a forced landing like that one, Jeff, I&rsquo;ll think
I&rsquo;m getting to be a pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I get taken into my uncle&rsquo;s airplane
passenger line,&rdquo; Dick spoke up, &ldquo;I know who&rsquo;ll
be Chief Pilot&mdash;until Larry gets the experience
to crowd Jeff out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, his face moody, said nothing.</p>
<p>The tall, slim pilot, grinned at the compliments
and then went on working his jaws on the
gum he habitually chewed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to trace my gas line and
ignition to see if a break made this trouble.&rdquo;
Jeff began removing his leather coat. &ldquo;Say! By
golly! Do you know where I think we&rsquo;ve set
down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sandy spoke meaningly. &ldquo;This is the
old Everdail estate&mdash;the one that&rsquo;s been in the
newspapers lately because the people around
here claim the hangar is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is!&rdquo; agreed Jeff. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you three take a look. Yonder&rsquo;s a hangar and
the roll-door is lifted a little. Maybe you&rsquo;d spot
that there Mister Spook and clear up the mystery
while I work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go down by the water and see if
it&rsquo;s cooler there,&rdquo; Sandy said, trying to catch
Larry&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;Since we got down out of the
cool air it&rsquo;s the hottest day this June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for the hangar!&rdquo; voted Dick. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s
any specters roaming through that hangar
you&rsquo;ll get more chills there than you will by the
Sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could stand a shiver or two,&rdquo; commented
Larry, leading the way toward the large, metal-sheathed
building at the end of the runway.</p>
<p>Facing them was a wide opening, sufficiently
spacious to permit airplanes to be rolled
through: in grooved slots at either side the
door, made of joined metal slats working like
the old-fashioned roll-top desk, could be raised
or lowered by a motor and cable led over a
drum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Sandy gave in, and as they walked toward
the hangar they discussed the stories that had
come out in the news about queer, ghostly noises
heard by passers-by on the state road late at
night, accounts of the fright the estate caretaker
had received when he investigated and saw a
queer, bluish glow in the place and was attacked
by something seemingly uncanny and not human.</p>
<p>The door, when they arrived, was seen to be
partially open, lifted about three feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an airplane in there&mdash;it looks to be
an amphibian&mdash;I see pontoons!&rdquo; Larry stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go have a look at it,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sandy spoke sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry and Dick straightened and stared in
surprise. It was very plain to be seen that
Sandy was not joking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Larry, in his practical way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think back,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;When school vacations
started and we began to stay around
the new Floyd Bennett airport that had opened
on Barren Island, Jeff had his &lsquo;crate&rsquo; there to
take people around the sky for short sight-seeing
hops, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Larry, &ldquo;and we got to be
friendly because we are crazy to be around airplanes
and pilots, and Jeff let us be &lsquo;grease
monkeys&rsquo; and help him get passengers, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely he did! But when we brought them
to go up with him, did he take their money and
fly them around, the way others did? Or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick admitted. &ldquo;He generally had
something wrong with the crate, or the wind
was too high, or he had stubbed his left foot
and met a cross-eyed girl, or saw a funeral passing,
and thought something unlucky might happen
from those signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe anybody can be as
superstitious as Jeff tries to make us believe he
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Lots of pilots are&mdash;they think an accident
will happen if anybody wears flowers in
their &lsquo;planes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Larry, let that go. But why did
Jeff bring us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, this morning, we had helped him
a lot and he didn&rsquo;t have money to pay us,&rdquo;
Larry answered. &ldquo;He offered us a joy-ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he come so far out on Long
Island, and <i>then get a dead stick</i> so handy to
this old estate that hasn&rsquo;t been lived in for years
and that has everybody scared so they won&rsquo;t
come near at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then get a dead stick!&rsquo;&rdquo; Larry shook his
head. &ldquo;Why, Sandy! I know you read detective
stories until you think everything is suspicious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do you read them&mdash;and Dick, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we read to try to guess the answers to
the mystery,&rdquo; Dick declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the
idea that real life is like those wild stories.
Everything looks as if it had some hidden mystery
behind it&mdash;I know what will be your new
nickname&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled to show there was no malice as
he stated the new name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicious Sandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Larry smiled. &ldquo;Suspicious
Sandy thinks a pilot gets a dead stick to make
us land near a haunted hangar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him cut the ignition switch!&rdquo; declared
Sandy defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did&mdash;and, what&rsquo;s more, here we are
at a spot where nobody comes because of the
ghost story&mdash;and he tells us to go into the
hangar and&mdash;the door is left up a little way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sandy, you&rsquo;re letting wild imagination
run away with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? All right. You two go on in&mdash;and
be held for ransom!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho-ho-ho! That&rsquo;s good. Suspicious Sandy&mdash;is
that somebody inside the hangar?&rdquo; Dick
changed his tone suddenly, dropping his voice
to a whisper as he stooped and saw something
move behind the old amphibian at the back of
the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw&mdash;but it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Larry retorted,
lowering his voice also.</p>
<p>By a common impulse of curiosity they
stooped and went in. Sandy, his own impulse
following theirs, was inside almost as quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anybody!&rdquo; Larry&rsquo;s eyes became
used to the duller light that filtered through the
thick dust on the roof skylight.</p>
<p>To their startled ears came a muffled clang,
a queer, hollow sound&mdash;and as they turned to
run back under the rolled-up door, it slid rapidly
down in its grooves, dropping into place
with a hollow rumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious golly!&rdquo; gasped Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; Larry was a little puzzled.</p>
<p>Sandy, half frightened, half triumphant,
spoke four words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">GHOSTS, GUM&mdash;AND GEMS</span></h2>
<p>For a long minute Dick, Larry and Sandy
stood in a compact group, feeling rather stunned
by the sudden springing of the trap, as they
considered the closed hangar.</p>
<p>Larry, calm and cool in an emergency, was
first to recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if Jeff did want to catch us and demand
ransom to let us go,&rdquo; he remarked quietly,
&ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t outside that rolling door&mdash;and I
don&rsquo;t think he could pull it down anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick agreed, seeing no fun in the situation
for once. &ldquo;See! There is a motor connected
to a big drum up in the top of the hangar, and
the door is counterbalanced so that turning the
drum winds up the cable that pulls it up. I
suppose the motor reverses to run it down
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s voice was tense and strained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>They heard the strange, hollow sound again,
seeming to come from the metal wall, but impossible
to locate at once because of the echo.</p>
<p>Rap&mdash;tap&mdash;tap!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s knocking,&rdquo; Dick gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not somebody&mdash;something!&rdquo; corrected
Sandy. &ldquo;The same &lsquo;something&rsquo; that worked
the door and shut it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious-to-gravy!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, do you, Sandy? Not
really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No human hand touched the switch that ran
that door down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it did!&rdquo; challenged Larry. &ldquo;We
thought we saw somebody at the back of the
hangar&mdash;that&rsquo;s why we came in! I&rsquo;m going to
see where he is, what he&rsquo;s doing and why he&rsquo;s
trying to fright&mdash;frighten us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke his sentence in the middle of a word
because the queer knocking repeated itself, but
with quick presence of mind he completed his
phrase to steady Sandy, whose face was growing
drawn with dismay.</p>
<p>Larry took a swift, sharp look around the
enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big, closed can for waste and oily
rags,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;but anyone would suffocate
who hid in that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a clothes cupboard&mdash;in the back
corner,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look in that, you
and I. Sandy, you stay back and keep watch.&rdquo;
Dick, quick to see Larry&rsquo;s attitude toward
Sandy, wanted to have a dependable chum at
his side as he investigated while he hoped to
give Sandy more confidence by leaving him in
the lighted part of the building, under the
smudged, dusty skylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; agreed Larry.</p>
<p>With Dick he walked boldly enough to the
built-in wooden cupboard, protected from dust
by a heavy burlap hanging.</p>
<p>Throwing the curtain aside sharply, both
youths peered in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but old overalls and some tools on
the floor,&rdquo; Dick commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s peculiar,&rdquo; Larry said doubtfully. &ldquo;Nobody
here&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; a new idea struck him.
Quietly he gestured toward the amphibian, old,
uncared for, looking almost ready to fall apart,
its doped wings stained with mould, its pontoons
looking as if the fabric was rotting on them.</p>
<p>Dick, instantly catching Larry&rsquo;s notion, went
to the forward seat, while Larry took the second
compartment behind the big fuel tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody here,&rdquo; he reported, and investigated,
by climbing in the vacant part of the fuselage
toward the tail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;This place is empty, too,&rdquo; Dick agreed.
&ldquo;Where could?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;Sandy almost screamed the word as
the dull, hollow knocks came again.</p>
<p>Larry leaped from the wing-step, sent his
sharp gaze rapidly around the enclosure and,
of a sudden, gripped Dick&rsquo;s arm so tightly that
the plump youth winced and grew chilly with
apprehension.</p>
<p>At once he saw Larry&rsquo;s amazed, relieved expression
and followed the older comrade&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>With an instant return of his old amused self
he threw back his head and let out a deep howl
of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ho-ho-ho-ha-ha! Oh, my!&mdash;ho-ho&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; demanded
Sandy. &ldquo;Have you gone silly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ho-ho! Suspicious Sandy!&mdash;ho-ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got us all worked up and worried,&rdquo; he
told Sandy, &ldquo;with your suspicions. And all the
time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho-ha-ha! All the t-time, we were like
mice racing around a treadmill.&rdquo; Dick had to
speak between chuckles. &ldquo;All the time we ran
around in circles so fast we didn&rsquo;t see the end
of the cage. Sus&mdash;suspicious Sandy! Thinking
we would be trapped and held for ransom!
Ho, golly-me! Look around you, Sandy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Sandy looked.</p>
<p>His face slowly changed, gradually became
red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; His voice was sheepish. &ldquo;You mean
the switch for the motor over by that small
metal door they use when they don&rsquo;t want to
run up the big one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That runs the motor,&rdquo; Larry agreed. &ldquo;The
cable must have slipped on the drum and let
the door go down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Sandy clung obstinately to his theories,
&ldquo;why did Jeff pick this haunted place and cut
the ignition&mdash;and why was the door up in the
first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we&mdash;ho-ho&mdash;care?&rdquo; Dick chuckled.
&ldquo;Another thing&mdash;even if the electric current is
off and the motor doesn&rsquo;t work&mdash;look at that
small, hinged door&mdash;do you see that the knob
of the spring lock&mdash;is on&mdash;our&mdash;side!&rdquo; He broke
out in a fresh cackle of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;those raps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reply Larry strode over to the metal door
set in the wall for use when anyone chose to
enter or leave the hangar.</p>
<p>Throwing it open, he faced Jeff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Took you long enough to answer!&rdquo; grumbled
Jeff. &ldquo;What made you fool with that door and
shut yourselves in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you cut the ignition!&rdquo; snapped
Sandy, working on the idea he had read in so
many detective stories that a surprise attack
often caused a person to be so startled as to
reveal facts.</p>
<p>Larry and Dick turned their eyes to Jeff.</p>
<p>The older pilot, staring at his accuser for an
instant, as though hesitating about some sharp
response, suddenly began to chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That-there is one on me!&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;You must have mighty quick eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t miss much!&rdquo; Sandy said meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us do!&rdquo; Dick caught the spirit of
Sandy&rsquo;s accusing manner. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve been
here before, too. There are lots of chunks of old
chewing gum stuck around in that front compartment
of the amphibian&mdash;and someone has
been working on it, too. I saw the signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chewing gum?&rdquo; Jeff was startled. Swiftly
he strode across the dimly sunlit floor, got onto
the forward step, peered into the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That-there certainly is queer,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Gum is stuck every
place, wads of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you chew gum!&rdquo; snapped Sandy, unwilling
to be left out of the suddenly developing
&ldquo;third degree&rdquo; he had begun. Jeff made a
further inspection, touched a bit of the dried
gum curiously, stepped down and stood with a
thoughtful face for a moment.</p>
<p>Presently he walked to an old soap box holding
metal odds and ends, washers, bolts and so
on. This he up-ended. He sat down, his lean
jaws working as he chewed his own gum slowly.
Around him, like three detectives watching the
effect of a surprise accusation, stood the chums.</p>
<p>Presently Jeff looked up at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks bad, this-here, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He grinned.</p>
<p>Dick, Larry and Sandy were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I better explain,&rdquo; Jeff decided. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t think you was so suspicious and quick or
I&rsquo;d of done different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t trap us!&rdquo; challenged Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trap you?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you make friends with us and
let us work on your crate and help get passengers
that you never took up? Didn&rsquo;t you say
you&rsquo;d give us a joy-ride, then come straight
here, cut out your ignition and make believe you
had a dead stick, land and then try to get us into
this haunted hangar?&rdquo; Sandy ran out of breath
and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think you ought to explain!&rdquo; Larry said
quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did all that&mdash;and I guess I will explain.
I meant to, anyhow&mdash;or I wouldn&rsquo;t have
brought you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited, neither convinced nor satisfied.</p>
<p>Fixing accusing eyes on Sandy, Jeff spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed you&rsquo;d be suspicious of me!
I made friends with you all and tried you out
to be sure you were dependable and honest and
all that&mdash;and I did bring you to this place because
it is so far from telephones and railroads.
But I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d get the wrong idea. I
only wanted you in a place it would take time to
get away from if you refused to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help you&mdash;help you with what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking seriously, Jeff replied to Larry&rsquo;s
challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me save the most valuable set of emeralds
in the world from being&mdash;destroyed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE SKY PATROL ORGANIZES</span></h2>
<p>Amazed, Dick challenged Jeff&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priceless emeralds&mdash;destroyed? You mean&mdash;robbers,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know for sure
who it is. But I do mean to ask you if you&rsquo;d
like to help me, and I don&rsquo;t think it would be
against robbers but against somebody that
wants to destroy the Everdail Emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Everdail Emeralds!&rdquo; Larry repeated
the phrase sharply. &ldquo;Why, Jeff! I&rsquo;ve read a
newspaper story about them, in a Sunday supplement.
That&rsquo;s the matched set of thirty
emeralds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curiously cut stones,&rdquo; interrupted Sandy.
&ldquo;I read about them too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matched stones&mdash;and priceless,&rdquo; added
Larry. &ldquo;The paper said they were a present
to one of Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s ancestors by one of the
most fabulously rich Hindu Nabobs who ever
lived.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;But who would want to destroy them?&rdquo; Dick
wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That-there is just what I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo;
Jeff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get into this?&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s suspicions
came uppermost.</p>
<p>Jeff drew a bulky, registered envelope from
his coat, displayed the registration stamps and
marks, and his name and address typed on the
envelope. Drawing out a half dozen hand written
sheets in a large masculine &ldquo;fist,&rdquo; he showed
the signature of Atley Everdail at the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This-here is what got me going,&rdquo; he stated.
&ldquo;Want to read it or will I give it to you snappy
and quick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy extended his hand and Jeff readily surrendered
the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m letting you see I am straight with you,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said we couldn&rsquo;t get away to tell anybody
anyway,&rdquo; Sandy said, but he was compelled
to admit to himself that although anyone
might write such a letter&mdash;even Jeff!&mdash;the postmark
was Los Angeles and the enclosure had
every appearance of sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind old Suspicious Sandy,&rdquo; urged
Dick. &ldquo;Let him read that, but you tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will check up, that way, too,&rdquo; smiled Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me!&rdquo; Jeff crossed his legs, leaning
against the metal wall, as he related an amazing
and mystifying series of events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty close to one of the richest men in
America,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You see, we both enlisted
in aviation units when the big war tore loose
and got Uncle Sam mixed up in it. We were
buddies, Atley and me. Well, after we came
back I stayed in aviation, knocking around from
control jobs to designing new gadgets like
superchargers and all. But when he went to
California and began to organize some passenger
flying lines, I stayed East in a commercial
pilot&rsquo;s job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter starts off as if you were old
friends,&rdquo; Sandy had to admit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddies&mdash;closer&rsquo;n brothers,&rdquo; nodded Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atley Everdail sold out stocks and stuff here
and went West to work out some pet ideas about
passenger transport,&rdquo; he told Dick and Larry.
&ldquo;Of course he bought a big place out there and
closed up this estate&mdash;put it up for sale. Hard
times kept it from selling, the same reason made
him hang onto that-there swell yacht he owned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of the <i>Tramp</i>,&rdquo; Dick
nodded. &ldquo;One fine boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is that!&rdquo; Jeff agreed. &ldquo;Well, as Sandy
must be reading, about where he&rsquo;s got in that
letter, Mrs. Everdail, who goes in for society
pretty strong, got a chance to be presented, this
Spring, before the King and Queen of England
at one of their receptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big honor,&rdquo; commented Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally she dug up all her finest jewelry,&rdquo;
surmised Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how!&rdquo; Jeff nodded. &ldquo;Now, that-there
Everdail necklace that was in his side of the
family for generations&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t took out
of the safe-deposit box once in a lifetime,
hardly. Most generally the missus wore a good
paste imitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to appear before royalty&mdash;&rdquo; Dick cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says, here, she took the real necklace, on
the yacht, when she went to England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy had lost his suspicious look. His interest,
as much as that of his older chums, was
caught and chained by the coming possibilities
and he put down the letter to listen to Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did take the string, as the letter says,&rdquo;
Jeff nodded. &ldquo;It was a secret&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t
broadcast it that the necklace was in the captain&rsquo;s
cabin, locked up in his safe. Nobody knew
it, not even the lady&rsquo;s personal maid, as far
as anybody supposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Everdail didn&rsquo;t go with her,&rdquo; guessed
Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was too busy routing air lines and working
out cost, maintenance and operation plans
for his big Western lines,&rdquo; explained Jeff. &ldquo;But
they took all the care in the world of those emeralds.
Even on the night of the reception, the
imitation string was taken to the hotel Mrs.
Everdail stayed at. That-there real necklace was
brought to the hotel, in person, by the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what could happen&mdash;did anything
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That-there is what started things,&rdquo; Jeff told
Dick. &ldquo;The missus was in her private suite, in
the dressing bowdoir or whatever it is, with nobody
but her French maid to help, and all the
jewels in a box in the room, hid in her trunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Sandy could hardly check
his eagerness to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was all but ready, dolled up like a circus,
I guess,&rdquo; Jeff grinned, and then became very
sober. &ldquo;All the jewelry was spread out to try
how this and that one looked, with her clothes,
separate and in different combinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened?&rdquo; persisted Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes a banging on that-there suite
door to the hall and a voice hollered, like it was
scared to death, &lsquo;Fire! Fire&mdash;get out at once!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she suspect any trick&mdash;was there a
trick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t have time to think. That French
maid went crazy and started to hop around like
a flea in a hot pan, and yelling, and it upset the
missus so much she forgot all about a fire escape
on the end window of the suite, and rushed out,
snatching up all the strings of beads and pearls
and the pins she could carry. But, because she
knew it was only imitation and there wasn&rsquo;t
anybody else around anyway, she didn&rsquo;t bother
about the emerald necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a false alarm&mdash;there was no fire!&rdquo;
Larry decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All she found was a paper of burnt matches
outside in the hotel corridor that had been set
off so when she opened the door she&rsquo;d smell
smoke. Of course she ran back&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he reached for the letter, and searched on
the fourth page, all three of his listeners were
holding their breath in suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he declared, and they crowded
around. &ldquo;Read it, so you&rsquo;ll see just what I
learned about when she went back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending close, intent and eager, they read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some strong, pungent liquid had been
poured on the green necklace,&rdquo; the letter from
the millionaire stated. &ldquo;No alarm was given.
My wife did not want to broadcast either the
fact that she had the real gems or the trouble
in the hotel. But people had heard the &lsquo;fire!&rsquo;
cry and doubtless some suspected the possible
truth, knowing why she was getting ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Parks came up later with the real
stones and while he waited for my wife to finish
her costume, he examined the fire escape window
and was sure that someone had entered
and left by that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Jeff,&rdquo; the letter concluded, &ldquo;my caretaker
on Long Island has sent me clippings
about a ghost scare on the old estate, and somehow
I connect that with the attempt to destroy
the emeralds. I can&rsquo;t imagine any motive, but
there are fanatics who do such things from a
warped sense of their duty or from spite and
hatred of rich folks. For old times&rsquo; sake, drop
everything, get down to bedrock on this thing
at your end&mdash;do whatever you think best, but
get in touch with the yacht, learn their plans, cooperate
with Captain Parks and my wife to
bring that necklace back to the vaults, and&mdash;I
count on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
like a mystery novel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no novel!&rdquo; Jeff said morosely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done about it?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Jeff explained. He had sent a radiogram to
the yacht, and as its owner had already sent one
identifying Jeff, he was given the information
that the real necklace was being brought back,
extra heavily insured in a London company, by
the captain himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I located and rented this crate we flew here
in,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I played joy-ride pilot by day
at the airport and hopped here of nights. But
I couldn&rsquo;t get a line on anything. I didn&rsquo;t notice
that chewing gum until you, Dick, Larry
and Sandy&mdash;all of you&mdash;started your third degree
and showed it to me. But I did think&mdash;if
anybody was playing ghost here, they might
be planning to use the old amphibian for something&mdash;maybe
to get away to get away with the emeralds
if they could get hold of them&mdash;in case anybody
thought the yacht was due to lay up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why you brought us here&mdash;to
help you watch?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. But it came over me that at
night I didn&rsquo;t get anywhere and I thought I&rsquo;d
try coming in the daytime&mdash;and being that the
yacht is due to make Long Island this afternoon,
I thought I might need some help with
a plan I&rsquo;ve worked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; eagerly. Sandy wanted details.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent the caretaker here&mdash;he&rsquo;s as dependable
as sunrise!&mdash;to a place out near Montauk
Point lighthouse, with Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s fast
hydroplane boat and I&rsquo;ve sent a radio message
to the yacht captain to be on the watch to meet
the hydroplane pretty well out to sea, and
transfer the necklace to the boat. Then, the
yacht will come on and make harbor here, as
though nothing had happened&mdash;and all the time
the emeralds will be on the way, down the Sound
and East River, to a wharf where I&rsquo;ll have a
motor car, with a dependable chum of mine, to
take charge and carry the package to safe deposit,
get a receipt&mdash;and there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t see how we can help!&rdquo; Sandy
spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to hop out in the airplane, sort of
oversee the business of the transfer, and escort
the hydroplane till she lands the emeralds, and
then circle around till my friend, with the receipt,
goes up onto the bank roof&mdash;it&rsquo;s pretty
high up&mdash;fourteen stories&mdash;and wig-wags an
O.K. And I&rsquo;d like dependable observers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one!&rdquo; cried Sandy, his suspicions swept
away. &ldquo;Number two is named Larry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dick is
a dependable third!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a regular Sky Patrol!&rdquo; exulted
Sandy. &ldquo;And watch what goes on while you do
the control job&mdash;and, that way&mdash;nothing can go
wrong!&rdquo; &ldquo;Not with the Sky Patrol &lsquo;over&rsquo;-seeing!&rdquo;
Dick, too, spoke overconfidently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">MYSTERY OVER THE OCEAN</span></h2>
<p>Three youths, thrilled by the prospect of a
mysterious adventure, and a war pilot, intent
on a friendly service, discussed plans for protecting
the Everdail Emeralds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how anything can slip up,&rdquo; Larry
gave his opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jeff spoke dubiously, uncertainly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone over all the things we can
think of that might go wrong&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what?&rdquo; demanded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a fortune teller read the cards for me,&rdquo;
Jeff told him. &ldquo;The nine o&rsquo; spades&mdash;the worst
card of warning in the pack&mdash;was right over me
and that means trouble&mdash;and the ace of spades,
a bad card&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crickety-Christmas!&rdquo; Larry was amazed.
&ldquo;Are you really telling us you believe in all
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that-there card fortune work out
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve twisted things that happened to fit
what you wanted to believe,&rdquo; argued Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Jeff did not want to discuss his
superstitions, &ldquo;maybe it won&rsquo;t come out so bad.
I met a pair of colored twins yesterday. That&rsquo;s
a good-luck sign&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Dick began to chuckle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got a queer combination to work with&mdash;our Sky
Patrol has! Suspicious Sandy&mdash;and&mdash;Superstitious
Jeff!&rdquo; Sandy grinned ruefully, a little
sheepishly. Larry smiled and shook his head,
warning Dick not to carry his sarcasm any
further, as Jeff frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you know when the yacht is due?&rdquo;
Larry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fixed up Atley&rsquo;s old short-wave radio, in
the old house&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been getting dope from
the yacht the last couple of nights. In about an
hour we&rsquo;ll take off, fly out beyond the lighthouse
and patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have enough gas?&rdquo; Larry inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had some delivered in cans early this morning&mdash;down
at the boathouse,&rdquo; Jeff told him.
&ldquo;We can fill up the main tank and get a reserve
in my small wing-tanks&mdash;enough for ten hours
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get busy!&rdquo; urged Sandy.</p>
<p>The three comrades were busy from then on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Only when Jeff was warming up the engine,
checking carefully on his instruments, taking
every precaution against any predictable failure,
was there time for a moment together and
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think of your suspicions?&rdquo;
Dick demanded. Sandy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the time I think I was letting imaginitis
get the best of me&mdash;but every once in
awhile I wonder&mdash;for one thing, why doesn&rsquo;t the
yacht sail right on to the New York wharf and
let the captain take those emeralds to safe deposit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-to-goodness, you&rsquo;re right, at that!&rdquo;
Larry nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For another thing,&rdquo; Sandy went on, &ldquo;anybody
could write that letter Jeff showed me&mdash;and
who is Jeff, when all is said and done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; argued Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let that go. But&mdash;he chews gum
and there&rsquo;s gum stuck all over in this amphibian&mdash;he&rsquo;s
been here, nights&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicion may be all right,&rdquo; Larry commented,
&ldquo;but what does it bring out, Sandy?
What is your idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is my idea! Nothing is what it seems
to be. Jeff pretends to be a joy-ride pilot, but
he never takes up passengers&mdash;hardly ever. The
engine dies, only it&rsquo;s Jeff stopping the &lsquo;juice.&rsquo;
This old amphibian crate looks as though it&rsquo;s
ready to come to pieces and yet, somebody has
been working on it&mdash;that chewing gum wasn&rsquo;t
stale and hard, because I made sure. Well&mdash;suppose
that Jeff was in a gang of international
jewel robbers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next you&rsquo;ll be saying the letter was in a
registered envelope from California and was
written in Cairo!&rdquo; laughed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in New York!&rdquo; corrected Sandy meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jewel robbers,&rdquo; Larry was serious. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think that holds water, Sandy. First of all, Jeff
claims to know that the emerald imitations had
acid poured on them&mdash;acid to destroy them.
That must be some chemical that corrodes or
eats emeralds. Now, robbers wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Sandy was stubborn. &ldquo;Suppose
they had gone to all that trouble to get into the
suite and discovered the false emeralds? What
would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might rip them apart&mdash;but do you think
robbers carry acids along to eat up emeralds if
they think they are going to profit by taking
them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicious Sandy,&rdquo; Dick began to chant a
rhyme he invented on the spur of the moment,
&ldquo;Suspicious Sandy, Suspicious Sandy, he thinks
everything is like April-Fool candy! Nothing
is what it seems to be and soon he&rsquo;ll suspect
both Larry and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned away, hurt, and strolled to the
amphibian with its retractable wheels for land
use and its pontoons for setting down on water.</p>
<p>Jeff called and signaled that all was ready.
Larry summoned Sandy but the latter lingered,
while Dick, a little sorry he had taunted so
much, followed Larry toward the waiting airplane.
But Sandy, scowling, hesitated whether
he would go or be angry and refuse to join the
Sky Patrol. Then, as he clambered onto the forward
bracing of the under wing and leaned on
the cockpit cowling, his face assumed a startled,
intent expression.</p>
<p>There was no chewing gum in the craft!</p>
<p>His first impulse was to rush out and declare
his discovery.</p>
<p>His next was to keep silent and avoid further
taunting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff chews gum,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;He pretended
not to know any was in this amphibian. But it&rsquo;s
gone! Well,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch and see
what he&rsquo;s up to. He&rsquo;ll give himself away yet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Assuming an air of having forgotten all about
Dick&rsquo;s rhyme, he went to his place in the seat
behind Jeff and the instant his safety belt was
snapped Jeff signaled to a farmer who had
come over to investigate and satisfy himself
that the airplane had legitimate business there;
the farmer kicked the stones used as chocks
from under the landing tires and Jeff opened
up the throttle.</p>
<p>With wind unchanged the trees which had
complicated their landing were behind them.
Jeff&rsquo;s only problem, Larry saw, was to get the
craft, heavier with its wing tanks full, off the
short runway and over the hangar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he gets a &lsquo;dead stick&rsquo; here,&rdquo; Larry mused,
&ldquo;it will be just too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no trouble lifting the craft and flying
for seconds just above the ground to get flying
speed after the take-off, then giving it full gun
and roaring up at a safe angle to clear the obstruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; exulted Dick.</p>
<p>They were&mdash;off on an adventure that was to
start with a mad race and terminate&mdash;in smoke!</p>
<p>Down the backbone of Long Island, not very
high, they flew. The farms, landscaped estates
and straight roads of the central zone were in
striking contrast to the bay and inlet dented
North Shore with its fleets of small boats, its
fishing hamlets, rolling hills and curving motor
drives and the seaside with its beach resorts,
yellow-brown sand and tall marsh grass clustered
between crab-infested salt water channels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Passing over the fashionable Summer homes
of wealthy people at Southampton, they held
the course until Montauk Point light was to the
left of the airplane, then Jeff swung in a wide
circle out over the desolate sand dunes, the
ooze and waving eel-grass of marshes and the
tossing combers of the surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the hydroplane!&rdquo; Dick, leaning over
the left side, made a pointing gesture. Larry,
watching seaward, had not been looking in the
right direction. Sandy, alert to pass signals,
touched Jeff and received a nod from the pilot.</p>
<p>The first step of the plan was taken. They
had made contact with the small, speedy craft
which, on a later signal that they had &ldquo;picked
up&rdquo; the incoming yacht, would speed out to
sea to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll climb!&rdquo; decided Sandy.</p>
<p>Climb they did, until the sea dropped down to
a gray-green, flat expanse and only the powerful
binoculars Larry was using could pick out
the cruising hydroplane slowly verging away
from the shore in an apparently aimless voyage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t such a bad scheme, at that,&rdquo; Dick
concluded mentally. &ldquo;If there should be anybody
on the lookout&mdash;robbers or somebody who
wants to see what&rsquo;s going on&mdash;no one will see
any connection between us passing here and then
climbing to get a good wind for a run down the
coast toward Maine, and a hydroplane that&rsquo;s
acting as if it had some engine trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higher and higher they went, probably out
of sight of anyone without strong field glasses,
and while they swung in a wide circle, Larry&rsquo;s
binoculars swept the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo; He turned the focusing adjustment
a trifle. &ldquo;Too soon to signal&mdash;it may be an
oil-burning steamer and not the yacht&mdash;or a
rum-runner of a revenue patrol&mdash;it&rsquo;s thick,
black oil smoke, the sort the yacht would give&mdash;it
is a small boat&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His signal, relayed through Dick and Sandy
to Jeff, shifted the gently banked curve into
a straighter line and swiftly the lines of the oncoming
craft, miles away, became clear.</p>
<p>Larry verified his decision that the low, gray
hull, with its projecting bowsprit, the rakish
funnel atop the low trunk of the central cabin,
and the yacht ensign, identified the <i>Tramp</i>.</p>
<p>The signal went forward.</p>
<p>Jeff, glancing back, caught Sandy&rsquo;s nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll dive to where the hydroplane can
see us, and the dive will signal the yacht that
we&rsquo;re the airplane they&rsquo;ll be watching for,&rdquo; Dick
decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The maneuver was executed, ending in a fairly
tight circle after Jeff had skilfully leveled
out of the drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke was trailing over the yacht&rsquo;s stern,&rdquo;
Sandy murmured. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s blowing off to the
starboard side. She&rsquo;s swinging toward us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through his glasses Larry saw the hydroplane
awaken the sea to a split crest of foam,
saw a cascade of moiling water begin to chase
her, and knew that the tiny craft was racing
out to the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; he grinned as Dick looked back.</p>
<p>Dick nodded and passed the report to Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy did not smile. Instead, as they swung,
he scanned the sky. That was not his instructions,
but it was his determined plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the amphibian Jeff was working on,
nights,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;It ought to be in sight
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convinced that both the hydroplane and the
yacht would have located the spot on the sea
where they would meet, Jeff broke the tedium
of his tight circle by a reverse of controls, banking
to the other side and swinging in a climbing
spiral to the right.</p>
<p>Closer and closer together came the swift turbine
propelled yacht and the surface-skimming
hydroplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was right!&rdquo; shouted Sandy, unheard but
triumphant&mdash;and also a little startled that he
had so closely guessed what would happen.</p>
<p>He swung his head, signaled Dick, waved an
arm, pointing. Dick and Larry stared, while
Sandy poked Jeff and repeated his gestures.</p>
<p>On the horizon, coming at moderate speed,
but growing large enough so that there could be
no error of identification, came the amphibian.
Its dun color and its tail marking were unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amphibian!&rdquo; cried Larry. &ldquo;I wonder
why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; Dick mused as Jeff
cut the gun and went into a glide, the better to
get a look at the oncoming craft low over the
seashore.</p>
<p>Larry realized with a pang that he was neglecting
Jeff&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>He looked down.</p>
<p>No glass was needed to show him the yacht,
swiftly being brought almost under them by its
speed and theirs. A quarter of a mile away was
the hydroplane, coming fast. A mile to the
south flew the approaching amphibian. And in
every mind&mdash;even Jeff&rsquo;s, had they been able to
read it&mdash;was the puzzled question, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Jeff began to climb in a tight upward spiral
to keep as well over the scene of activity as he
could without being in the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to be high enough to interfere if something
has slipped,&rdquo; Larry decided on the purpose
in Jeff&rsquo;s mind. Then, as the amphibian
came roaring up a hundred yards to their left,
and in a wide swing began to circle the yacht,
Sandy screeched in excitement and pointed
downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening!&rdquo; he screamed.</p>
<p>Swiftly Larry threw his binoculars into focus
as he swept the length of the yacht to discover
what caused Sandy&rsquo;s cry, for with a wing in his
way he did not see the stern. They swung and
he gave a shout of dismay and amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly he corrected himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but there&rsquo;s a life preserver in the water&mdash;it
was thrown over but the yacht isn&rsquo;t stopping.&rdquo;
His glasses swept the bridge, the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No excitement&mdash;now, I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lenses brought the stern and after cabin
into view.</p>
<p>Turning away, back to his view, in a dark
dress, a woman who had been at the extreme
after rail was racing out of sight behind the
cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a life preserver in the water!&rdquo; Dick
could see it without glasses. Sandy looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amphibian is making for it!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hydroplane can&rsquo;t get there in time!&rdquo;
shouted Larry.</p>
<p>None of them realized that Jeff&rsquo;s roaring engine
drowned their cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff! Look&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Wildly Sandy gesticulated.</p>
<p>Fast and high, in a swift glide, coming like
a hawk dropping to its prey, a light seaplane,
skimming the edge of an incoming fog bank,
showed its slim, boatlike fuselage and wide
wingspan, with two small pontoons at wingtips
to support it in the surf.</p>
<p>There was a swift drop of their own craft as
Jeff dived, came into a good position and
zoomed past the yacht, close to it.</p>
<p>Wildly, as those on the bridge came into clear
view, Sandy, Larry, Dick and Jeff gesticulated,
pointing astern. Bells were jangled, the yacht
was sharply brought up by reversed propellers
and a tender was swiftly being put down from
its davits, an excited sailor working to start its
engine, even as it was lowered.</p>
<p>Then, helpless to take active part because
they had no pontoons, the Sky Patrol witnessed
the maddest, strangest race staged since aviation
became a reality. And the prize? A mysteriously
flung life preserver!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">MYSTERY IN THE FOG</span></h2>
<p>While Sandy watched the amphibian and
Dick stared at the rapidly approaching sea
plane, Larry gazed at the swift hydroplane and
noted the feverish attempt on the yacht to get
its tender going as it struck the surging water.</p>
<p>Swiftly he snapped the binoculars to his eyes
as they receded from the yacht in the onrush
of their zoom.</p>
<p>A woman in dark clothes had rushed behind
the after cabin.</p>
<p>She must have tossed the life preserver from
the stern.</p>
<p>But there was a woman on the bridge with the
white uniformed captain and a navigating officer.
She was in dark clothes! But she had been
there all the time. He suddenly recalled the
French maid Jeff had mentioned in the hotel.
That answered his puzzled wonder. He knew
who had thrown that life preserver, at any rate.
It could not be the mistress. It left only the
maid to suspect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Fast as a dart the hydroplane cut the surges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get there&mdash;they see the life preserver!&rdquo;
he cried, looking past the tilting wing
as they executed a split-S to turn to head back
the quickest possible way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amphibian can set down on the water
and she&rsquo;ll pass the place&mdash;already there&rsquo;s somebody
climbing out of the front cockpit onto the
wing&mdash;to grab the thing as they pass!&rdquo; Sandy
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seaplane is coming fast!&rdquo; mused Dick.
&ldquo;What a race! It will be a wonder if there
isn&rsquo;t a smash when they all come together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took only seconds for the race to conclude.</p>
<p>With a warning cry that was drowned by
their engine noise, Larry saw that the amphibian
was in such a line of flight that it must be
crossed by the course of the hydroplane&mdash;and
from the respective speeds, as well as he could
judge, there might be either a collision or one
of the craft must alter its course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seaplane is almost down on the water&mdash;and
coming like an arrow toward that white
preserver!&rdquo; gasped Dick. &ldquo;Will its wings hit
the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do anything at all?&rdquo; Sandy wondered
desperately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Evidently Jeff either caught his thought or
decided on a course through his own quick wit.</p>
<p>Opening the throttle full-on, he kicked rudder
and depressed his left wing. Around came
the airplane. Skidding out of her course from
the momentum and the sharp application of
control, she moved sharply upward and sidewise.</p>
<p>Deftly Jeff caught the skid.</p>
<p>Righted, Sandy exultantly screeched at the
maneuver.</p>
<p>Flying fast, in a steep descent, they went
across the nose of the amphibian, and in the
turmoil of their propeller wash she went almost
out of control, and before her pilot caught up
his stability the hydroplane raced across her
path in a slanting line and made for the small
round object bobbing in the trough between two
swells.</p>
<p>But that gave the seaplane an advantage.</p>
<p>Quick to take it, dipping a wing and kicking
rudder, the seaplane&rsquo;s pilot swerved a little,
leveled off, and set down in a smother of foam,
and on his wing also a man climbed close to the
tip!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the one who was on the amphibian
wing?&rdquo; Larry wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the water, spilled by our wash,&rdquo; he decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>He had no time to pay attention to that situation.
The imminent culmination of the race
chained his gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tender is almost there&mdash;oh!&rdquo; gasped
Sandy, &ldquo;the seaplane must be rammed by the
tender!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the yacht&rsquo;s boat, with its motor hastily
started, and cold&mdash;lost way as the engine sputtered
and died!</p>
<p>Slackening speed, the seaplane raced along
until, with a hand clinging to a brace and his
body leaning far over the dancing waves, its
passenger on the wing scooped up the life preserver.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the seaplane began to get
off the water.</p>
<p>The tender, its engine missing badly, turned
its attention to the man in the water, but before
it could get to him or near him Sandy, Dick
and Larry saw that he caught the tail assembly
of the amphibian and scrambling over the fuselage
as the craft picked up speed, fell flat on
his stomach just behind the pilot&rsquo;s place and
clung tightly while the craft got &ldquo;on the step&rdquo;
and went into the air in a swift moil of foam
and a roaring of its engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Outgeneraled, the hydroplane cut speed and
swung toward the yacht, followed by the tender.</p>
<p>The race was out of their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on us!&rdquo; panted Sandy. &ldquo;Jeff&mdash;get
after that seaplane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their pilot needed no instructions.</p>
<p>Kicking rudder and dipping a wing, almost
wetting it in the spray of a breaking comber,
he flung his airplane into a new line of flight,
reversed controls, giving opposite rudder and
aileron, got his craft on a stable keel and gave
it the gun as he snapped up the flippers to lift
her nose and climb after the retreating &rsquo;plane.</p>
<p>Far behind them in their swift chase, with
every ounce of power put into their engine and
their whole hearts urging it to better speed, the
Sky Patrol saw the amphibian swerve toward
shore and give up the try for whatever that
precious life preserver had attached to it.</p>
<p>That something had been cast overboard, tied
to the float, was obvious to Larry, Dick and
Sandy.</p>
<p>Nothing else explained its employment.</p>
<p>What a chase! Speed was in their favor,
because the seaplane, fast as it was, lacked the
power of their engine which they learned later
that Jeff had selected for that very quality.</p>
<p>Overhauling the seaplane was not the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Their problem was to get above it, to ride it
down, force it to take the sea or to come down
in a crackup on shore if that must be&mdash;before
it could lose itself in that dull, gloomy, lowering
bank of fog ahead.</p>
<p>For that fog the seaplane was making at full
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb, Jeff!&rdquo; Sandy begged, hoping their
pilot could ride down the craft ahead.</p>
<p>But Jeff held a level course. He had to, in
order to maintain the advantage of speed. He
thought he could get alongside their quarry before
the mist swallowed it, hid it, ended the
pursuit.</p>
<p>In that he was beaten by only a hundred
feet.</p>
<p>Into the murky folds of the thick mist dived
the seaplane.</p>
<p>Hardly more than two hundred feet behind,
they felt the cold, clammy fingers of the cloud
touch their shrinking faces.</p>
<p>Jeff cut the gun.</p>
<p>They strained their ears.</p>
<p>Where was the seaplane? Would it climb
above the murk, glide straight through it and
down, swerve and glide&mdash;or dive out and risk
leveling off and setting down just beneath the
bank so that its rapidly coming folds, and the
silent sea would make a safe and comfortable
concealment?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Slowly, almost in a &ldquo;graveyard&rdquo; glide, so flat
was the descent, to hold flying speed and stay
as high as they could, their airplane moved
along. They listened.</p>
<p>Only the raucous cry of a seagull cut into
that chill silence!</p>
<p>The fog kept its secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t last long, for us,&rdquo; thought Larry.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be down to the water before we know
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much the same idea made Dick peer anxiously
over the cowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be listening for us, in the seaplane,&rdquo;
Sandy decided. &ldquo;I know there was a
pilot and the man who got the life preserver.
I wish I could have gotten a good look at either
one, but the pilot had goggles and his helmet
to hide his face and the other man had his back
turned to us. Where can they be? What are
they doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could not wait for the answer.</p>
<p>Through a thin cleft in the heavy mist, not
far below them the dark outlines of eel-grass,
flanking two sides of a channel in the swampy
shore line stood out, for an instant, clear and
menacing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff!&rdquo; warned Sandy.</p>
<p>Dick echoed the cry. Jeff had already caught
the threat of that swamp below them. They
could not risk going a foot lower. The pilot
opened his throttle, picking up climbing speed
to the roar of his engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to give in first,&rdquo; Larry decided ruefully.</p>
<p>Not only had they given in. Jeff, it appeared,
had given up. In thickening mist the risks were
too great.</p>
<p>They had given up.</p>
<p>Jeff was climbing for the top of the bank,
where he could come into the clear, get some
idea of his location and return to report defeat
to the yacht whose captain probably lay-to,
waiting for news.</p>
<p>Nor did Jeff again cut the gun to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Dick was always hopeful, &ldquo;maybe
we&rsquo;ll get a &lsquo;break&rsquo; sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up, and still climbing, the airplane continued
through the fog.</p>
<p>Low banks favored them.</p>
<p>With suddenly thinning rifts parting overhead
they shot out into the clear sunlight. Beneath,
stretching up disappointed fingers of
murk lay the bank of fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;toward shore!&rdquo; screamed Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE END OF THE CHASE</span></h2>
<p>Instantly the situation became clear to the
Sky Patrol.</p>
<p>Having heard their own engine, the pilot of
the seaplane had decided to risk a dash out of
the fog and to try to escape.</p>
<p>Their own airplane had been headed south,
down the coast.</p>
<p>When they climbed above the lower shoreward
mist the cry from Sandy drew their attention
to the seaplane, even higher than they
were, and going fast across the narrow end of
the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can catch them and ride them
down!&rdquo; exulted Dick.</p>
<p>Jeff dropped a wing sharply&mdash;kicking rudder
at the same time. Onto the trail swung their
craft. Righting it Jeff gave the engine all it
would take, climbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting ahead&mdash;getting away from
us!&rdquo; cried Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Larry, more conversant with flying tactics,
decided that Jeff meant to get to a higher level
than they occupied, to outclimb the less flexible
seaplane, so that he could swoop upon it with
the advantage of elevation to help him overtake
it.</p>
<p>Into the thousands their altimeter swung its
indicator.</p>
<p>Three thousand feet! Another five hundred!
Four thousand!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must be higher than they are!&rdquo;
Larry muttered. &ldquo;Jeff&mdash;for crickety-Christmas&rsquo;
sake&mdash;catch them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff leveled and their engine roared. In a
quartering course, evidently making in an airline
for some point on the Connecticut side of
Long Island Sound, the seaplane held its way.</p>
<p>Gaining in a very flat descent, calculated, as
Sandy could see, to bring them either alongside
or&mdash;if fortune favored them&mdash;onto the tail of
the other craft, Jeff drew closer.</p>
<p>The seconds slipped by. The North Shore
was almost under them.</p>
<p>Swiftly the distance closed up between the
racing flyers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re diving!&rdquo; cried Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s gone wrong!&rdquo; Dick yelled.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out of control!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The seaplane sheered to one side in a violent
slip as her pilot evidently tried to bank and
kick rudder and lost control.</p>
<p>The seaplane wavered, caught itself in a
steadier line. In the pursuing airplane three
youthful faces grew intent.</p>
<p>What was wrong?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s diving!&rdquo; screamed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened!&rdquo; decided Larry.</p>
<p>Down, almost like a hawk falling to its prey,
the seaplane went through the still air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s on the wing&mdash;he&rsquo;s jumping
clear!&rdquo; shouted Dick.</p>
<p>Trembling with excitement Larry caught up
the binoculars. They were still too far behind
for clear vision unaided by glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has that life preserver in one hand&mdash;there
he goes!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>Silhouetted against the northern blue of the
sky, with a tiny white circle showing sharply
in the sunlight, the leaping person fell clear of
the diving seaplane, while Larry, shaking with
excitement, tried to focus his glasses and train
them on the falling object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s harnessed to a parachute&mdash;there goes
the ripcord!&rdquo; Sandy would have leaped to his
feet but for his restraining safety belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the &rsquo;chute!&rdquo; Dick was equally
thrilled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The parachute opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life preserver snapped out of his hand!&rdquo;
Larry muttered, giving up his effort to locate
the moving objects in the glass and using his
unaided eyes to view the tragedy&mdash;or whatever
it would prove to be.</p>
<p>The life preserver was jerked away by the jar
when the parachute arrested the fall sharply,
making it impossible for a handgrip to retain
the rope of the swiftly plunging white circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the other one jump clear!&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s heart seemed to be tearing to get out
through his tightening throat. Which one was
under the parachute? Which stayed in the falling
seaplane&mdash;and why?</p>
<p>An arm of mist, swinging far over the land,
intervened between their vision and the shore
line.</p>
<p>Into it, hidden from sight, the seaplane
flashed.</p>
<p>Through its concealing murk flicked the tiny
round object of mystery.</p>
<p>More deliberately, settling down, first the
hanging bulk of the unknown man, then the
spreading folds of the parachute drifted into
mist&mdash;and mystery.</p>
<p>The chase was ended.</p>
<p>But the mystery had hardly begun!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE SWAMP GIVES UP A CLUE</span></h2>
<p>Two courses were offered to the Sky Patrol
with Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try to drop down into the fog,&rdquo;
called Larry to Dick as their pilot, with closed
throttle, nosed down to get closer to the scene
of the tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t set down or do anything&mdash;and
we can&rsquo;t see much for the fog,&rdquo; objected Dick.
&ldquo;I think we ought to go back and drop a note
onto the yacht, telling the people to come here
in a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry agreed with this sensible suggestion
and Dick, scribbling a note, passed it to Sandy.
After a glance the younger of the trio gave it to
Jeff. The pilot nodded when he read it.</p>
<p>Again the engine roared as they swung
around, laying a course to take them above the
rolling mist, toward the end of the island around
which&mdash;or beyond which&mdash;the yacht should be
cruising or waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be hard to find the yacht in this fog,&rdquo;
Sandy mused, but as they flew along he, with
the others, scanned the low clouds for some
open rift through which to catch a possible
glimpse of the water craft. A slantwise gust
of wind crossed the cockpits, giving them new
hope. If a breeze came to blow aside the mist
they might have better chances to see the yacht.</p>
<p>In steadily increasing force, and gradually
coming oftener, the puffs of moving air increased
their confidence.</p>
<p>The fog was thinning under them, blowing
aside, swirling, shifting.</p>
<p>With the breeze from the new direction, as
they steadily got closer to the end of the island,
coming over a spot where a break in the cloud
showed brown-yellow sand and rushing white
surf beyond the wide level beach, Sandy&rsquo;s alert
eyes caught sight of something for an instant.
Prodding Jeff, he indicated the object.</p>
<p>As Jeff swooped lower, inspecting, Dick
caught a good glimpse of the tilted, quiet focus
of Sandy&rsquo;s gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the amphibian,&rdquo; Dick muttered.
&ldquo;Stranded&mdash;cracked up, maybe. But&mdash;if we
could get down and land, we could use her, two
of us could, to go to the swamp and see what&rsquo;s
there&mdash;before anybody else gets to the life preserver
the jewels must have been tied to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>He passed forward, through Sandy, a note.</p>
<p>Jeff agreed, made his bank and turn, as
Sandy saw the drift of a plume of smoke on
the horizon, to get into the wind.</p>
<p>Coming back, dropped low, Jeff scanned the
beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks safe for a landing&mdash;pretty solid
beach,&rdquo; Larry concluded, and evidently Jeff felt
the same way for he climbed in his turning
bank, got the wind right and came down, using
his engine with partly opened throttle to help
him settle gradually until the landing wheels
touched when the tail dropped smartly, the gun
was cut, and the sand, fairly level and reasonably
well-packed, dragged them to a stop.</p>
<p>Hurriedly the youthful Sky Patrol tumbled
onto the sand, digging cotton plugs out of their
ears now that the roar of the motor no longer
made them essential.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the amphibian, and no mistake!&rdquo; Larry
cried, running down the beach toward the titled
craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t damaged,&rdquo; he told Dick, &ldquo;you
and Jeff, or Jeff and I could fly to the swamp
in her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;You go.&rdquo; Dick was generous to the friend
he admired, and who was almost a year older.
&ldquo;It would need a cool, quick head to handle
whatever you might find in the swamp. You
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That also was Sandy&rsquo;s opinion when, after a
rapid inspection, they agreed with Jeff that the
amphibian, set down with only a strained tail
skid and a burst tire in the landing wheel gear,
was usable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no gas,&rdquo; objected Larry, noting
the indicator in the control cockpit. &ldquo;See, the
meter says zero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that way when I looked before,&rdquo;
Sandy said. &ldquo;That was why I didn&rsquo;t think anybody
meant to use it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to fool you on that,&rdquo; Jeff declared.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been disconnected. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if that-there tank wasn&rsquo;t nearly half full. They
had it all fixed and ready&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, then,&rdquo; urged Larry. &ldquo;Dick, look
over the pontoons for strains, will you? She
may have struck one of them&mdash;she has tipped
over part way, maybe hit one of the pontoons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Dick, examining with the thoroughness of an
expert, with Jeff&rsquo;s and his chum&rsquo;s life perhaps
depending on his care, stated that he saw no
damage to the waterproofed coverings of the
water supports. Declaring that they would
stand by and watch the airplane, Sandy and
Dick watched Larry and Jeff get settled, Dick
spun the propeller to pump gas into the still
heated cylinders, Jeff gave the &ldquo;switch-on&mdash;contact!&rdquo;
call, Dick, pulling down on the &ldquo;prop,&rdquo;
sprang aside to avoid its flailing blades, and the
amphibian&rsquo;s engine took up its roar.</p>
<p>Acting as a ground crew, Dick righted the
craft by thrusting up the wing which was evidently
not seriously damaged, while Sandy, as
the motor went into its full-throated drone,
shook the tail to lift the skid out of the
clogging sand. His eyes shielded from the sand,
blasted back by the propeller wash, he leaped
sidewise and backward as the elevators lifted
the tail and the amphibian shook itself in its
forward lunge, lifted, flew within two inches
of the sand, and then began to roar skyward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drawing up the wheels, now,&rdquo; Sandy
called to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be any good, with that burst
tire&mdash;he&rsquo;ll have to set down in water anyhow,&rdquo;
Dick explained. Sandy nodded.</p>
<p>Waving to his two watching comrades as they
grew smaller to his peering eyes, Larry turned
his attention to the work of scanning, from the
forward place, all the indented shore line, north,
that the mist had uncovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>To their left, as they sped on, the lighthouse
poked its tower out of the drifting, dispelling
fog.</p>
<p>Soon Jeff dropped low, diminished the throb
of the engine, cruising while Larry kept watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder it is!&rdquo; Larry&rsquo;s hand gestured ahead
and to the side.</p>
<p>Jeff, peering, located the wing of the seaplane,
the fuselage half submerged in muddy
channel ooze, the tail caught on the matted eel-grass.</p>
<p>In the mouth of a broad channel they touched
water and ran out of momentum with the wings
hovering over the grassy bank to either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; demanded Jeff. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go
in any closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Larry had his coat and shoes off.
Stripping them off, and with no one to observe,
removing all his clothes, he lowered himself
onto a pontoon and thence to the water,
chilly but not too cold on the hot June afternoon.</p>
<p>Striking out with due care not to get caught
by any submerged tangle of roots or grasses,
Larry swam the forty feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pilot&rsquo;s in his cockpit&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get that collapsible boat on the back of the
tank, there!&rdquo; urged Jeff, &ldquo;and come back for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took inexperienced Larry some time to
open and inflate the tubular rubber device used
for supporting survivors of any accident to the
seaplane while afloat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;I think he&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Jeff declared fifteen
minutes later. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad slam he&rsquo;s had
on the forehead, though.&rdquo; He lifted the silent
pilot&rsquo;s bruised head, put a hand on his heart,
nodded hopefully and bade Larry dash water in
the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The cold, salty liquid seemed at first to have
no effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have hit himself trying to get out,&rdquo;
Larry surmised.</p>
<p>Jeff shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His parachute isn&rsquo;t loosened or unfolded,&rdquo;
he responded, working to get the spark of life
to awaken in the man he bent over. &ldquo;No, Larry,
from the looks of things&mdash;somebody hit him,
while they were away up in the air, and jumped&mdash;with
that life preserver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now? If only I could get my
hands on him. I wonder who it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff paid no attention to Larry&rsquo;s natural
anger and wonder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming around&mdash;fella&mdash;who did this-here
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes fluttered open, the lips trembled.</p>
<p>Larry, clinging to a brace, his feet set on a
strut, bent closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? Who done this?&rdquo; repeated
Jeff.</p>
<p>The man, before he sank again into silence,
uttered one word&mdash;or half a word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gast&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gast&mdash;was it somebody named Gaston?&rdquo;
asked Jeff.</p>
<p>The man did not respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Larry urged. &ldquo;Can you get
him into the boat, somehow, Jeff? You ought
to land him at a hospital&mdash;or at the nearest airport.
There&rsquo;s a medical officer at every one&mdash;for
crack-ups. Or, fly and telephone for help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be afraid to stay here if I take
him to an airport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; declared Larry, stoutly.</p>
<p>Without further words or conscious movements
from the silent pilot they managed to get
him unhooked from his belt and parachute harness,
to lower him, precariously limp, into the
rubber boat, which Larry held onto as Jeff, half
supporting his inert co-pilot, propelled it to
their own craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>As they moved slowly along Larry, fending
off a clump of tough grass into which the breeze
sought to drift their rubber shell, caught sight
of something dimly white, far in among the
muddy grass roots.</p>
<p>He left his support, swam across the smaller
channel, carefully, and secured the life preserver
which had dropped into a heavy clump
of the grass and then had floated free of the
mud, held only by the end of a tangled string&mdash;and
the skin of an empty, oilskin pouch, torn
and ripped to tatters, that hung to the cord.</p>
<p>When Larry rejoined Jeff, he flung the life
preserver into the space behind the control seat
of the amphibian, leaving it there without comment
as he helped Jeff to lift and drop the still
unconscious man into his own forward place.</p>
<p>Then, pushing off in the rubber boat, he sat
still, his dry clothes in a compact bundle in the
boat thwarts, while Jeff let the wind and tide-run
carry his amphibian out of the channel to
where he could get sea space for a start, to get
the amphibian pontoons &ldquo;on the step&rdquo; from
which, with his silent cargo of human tragedy,
Jeff lifted into air and went out of sight, southbound.</p>
<p>Sitting until he dried, Larry donned his garments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gast&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Gast&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he heard any name around the airports
like Gaston?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;its something, now, anyway.
We can look for a Frenchman&mdash;and learn
if there&rsquo;s one named Gaston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sculled back to get under the shading, up-tilted
wing of the seaplane, studying what he
saw of its half submerged after place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory-gosh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, staring.</p>
<p>There, neatly arranged, was the row of
chewed bits of gum!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">SANDY MEETS A &ldquo;SUSPECT&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy and Dick, standing by the airplane on
the beach, whirled to see a short, stoutish man
in regulation flying togs come unexpectedly into
view from behind an inshore hillock of sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; the man continued,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gaze was bent on the aircraft.</p>
<p>Sandy discerned instantly that he was looking
at the pilot who had handled the control job
on the amphibian during the recent excitement.</p>
<p>The stranger had a pleasant, round face, with
eyes that twinkled in spite of the creases around
them that showed worry. No wonder he was
worried, Sandy thought: having deserted the
craft they had foiled in its attempt to get the
gems, the man had returned from some short
foray to discover his craft replaced by another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; Dick greeted the stranger and replied
to his exclamation. &ldquo;No, sir, you&rsquo;re not
seeing things! At least you&rsquo;re not if you mean
the airplane near where the amphibian was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy wanted to nudge his comrade, to warn
him to be careful. There was no chance; the
man was observing them intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amphibian? You know the different types,
eh? May I ask if you belong around here, and
if not, how you got here&mdash;and who took the
&lsquo;phib&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to check Dick, his younger chum had
to stand, listening while Dick related some of
their most recent adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe! So you&rsquo;re two of
the lads who were in the other &lsquo;crate&rsquo;. Where&rsquo;s
the third&mdash;and was that Jeff with you? I
thought it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superstitions and all!&rdquo; chuckled Dick.</p>
<p>Dick judged the man to be both friendly and
&ldquo;all right,&rdquo; from his pleasant, affable manner
and his evident knowledge of their pilot&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Not so Sandy!</p>
<p>His mind leaped through a multitude of theories
and of suspicions.</p>
<p>This man might be &ldquo;in cahoots&rdquo; with Jeff,
and Sandy was determined not to take Jeff, or
anyone else, at face value too readily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The whole strange affair looked &ldquo;queer&rdquo; to
him.</p>
<p>Jeff had falsified the true reason for the landing
in the Everdail field. He might falsify other
things&mdash;his real reason for flying out to the
yacht. This man might be his partner in some
hidden scheme. Even the Everdail Emeralds,
Sandy decided, might be just &ldquo;made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has been what it seemed to be,&rdquo; he
mentally determined. &ldquo;I wish Dick would be
careful what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Dick had already given the man a sidelight
on Jeff&rsquo;s character by mentioning his
superstitions, it occurred to Sandy that he
might learn, from the stranger&rsquo;s reply, how well
he knew Jeff.</p>
<p>His expression, as Sandy watched narrowly,
became one of amusement, he smiled broadly,
threw back his head and as he answered Dick&rsquo;s
phrase about superstitions and all, he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have walked under a ladder, from
the way things have turned out,&rdquo; he said,
amusedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, please?&rdquo; Sandy shot the question
out suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Oh&mdash;&rdquo; Did the man hesitate, Sandy
wondered. It seemed to be so before he continued.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Everdail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Everdail?&rdquo; Even Dick, questioning as
he repeated the name, was a little doubtful.
&ldquo;Why, I thought Mr. Everdail was in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;California? So I was. But one of my air
liners brought me across in record time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anybody could have learned that the millionaire
was in California, Sandy reflected; it would
be easy for a clever jewel robber, one of a band,
to impersonate the man when he was caught off
guard by their exchange of aircraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you boys were with Jeff you must be all
right,&rdquo; the man advanced, hand extended.</p>
<p>Dick shook it warmly.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s grip was less cordial, but he played
the part of an unsuspecting youth as well as
he could by finishing the handshake with a
tighter grip and a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Jeff might be in the ship, yonder,
until he nearly threw us out of control with his
propeller wash. Then I thought&mdash;he might be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought you might be&mdash;&rdquo; Dick smiled as
he made the response, winking broadly.</p>
<p>Sandy wished his chum would be more careful.</p>
<p>The man who called himself Mr. Everdail
nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re not, and I&rsquo;m not&mdash;what
neither of us cared to say,&rdquo; he turned toward
the airplane, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get together! I&rsquo;m here because
my passenger, a buddy of mine, wrenched
his shoulder climbing back into the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; and
we set down here so I could leave him at the
fishing shack, yonder, and go back to see what
was what. He was in too bad shape to take
chances if I felt called on to do any stunts&mdash;I
thought I could take the air in time to catch
that seaplane coming out of the fog, but it
fooled me. I already know why you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;suppose we hop off in Jeff&rsquo;s &lsquo;crate&rsquo;
and give a look-see if your friend and my war
buddy need any help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t set down if they do,&rdquo; objected
Sandy, his confidence in the man&rsquo;s possible guilt
shaken by his knowledge of Jeff&rsquo;s war record.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, for my part, why Jeff didn&rsquo;t use
the amphibian in the first place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered about that when I got in at the
estate, soon after you&rsquo;d left,&rdquo; Mr. Everdail&mdash;or
the man who claimed to be the millionaire&mdash;asserted.
&ldquo;I could see he had been working on
it, getting it ready&mdash;even had the tank full up,
but he had disconnected the fuel gauge to fool
anybody who might be looking around, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he landed and changed his mind
about using it,&rdquo; Dick suggested. &ldquo;On account
of taking us in&mdash;we organized a sort of Sky
Patrol, to oversee things&mdash;but everything went
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That accounts for it. I didn&rsquo;t know he was
going to make the hop or I might not have come
myself&mdash;but now&mdash;well,&rdquo; the man broke off his
phrase and started to clamber into the control
seat, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave your passenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s comfortable, lying quiet in the fishing
shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, who had spoken, felt his suspicions returning
at the reply. Could there be any reason
why they must not identify the other man?
Might he be the ringleader, or have some outstanding
mark that they had seen before and
might recognize?</p>
<p>Dick performed the &ldquo;mech&rsquo;s&rdquo; duties for the
pilot in getting the engine started again, then
he clambered into his old place. Sandy was
already behind their new pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever and whatever he is,&rdquo; Sandy mused,
&ldquo;he knows how to lift a &lsquo;crate&rsquo; out of the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man claiming to be Mr. Everdail made a
skillful getaway from the beach, and it took
them very little time to get over the marsh, already
free of fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Dick located the crack-up, Sandy indicated
the spot and the pilot dropped so low that his
trucks almost grazed the waving eel-grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no amphibian in sight, though!&rdquo;
Dick murmured. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Larry! Yoo-hoo!&rdquo; Sandy shouted.</p>
<p>Larry, in his rubber boat, just having given
up trying to explain how a number of bits of
chewing gum had transferred themselves from
the amphibian, where last he saw them&mdash;or
some like them&mdash;to the seaplane, gestured and
pantomimed to try to tell them his news.</p>
<p>Flying past they could not fully understand.</p>
<p>The new pilot waved a reassuring glove at
Larry and swerved back toward the end of the
island. Larry wondered who he was and what
his comrades were doing with him; but Larry,
always practical, let the questions wait for their
eventual answers and continued to study the
half-sunken seaplane.</p>
<p>No new clues offered themselves. He detached
one of the hard, adhering chunks of gum and
dropped it into his pocket, &ldquo;just in case,&rdquo; he
said, half-grinning, &ldquo;just in case they transfer
themselves somewhere else. I&rsquo;ll leave twenty-nine
of them&mdash;and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The supposed Mr. Everdail scribbled a note
which he handed back to Sandy, who caught his
idea of dropping instructions on the deck of the
yacht.</p>
<p>Borrowing Dick&rsquo;s jackknife for a weight,
Sandy prepared the message.</p>
<p>Cruising slowly the yacht came into sight.</p>
<p>Their pilot was skillful at coursing in such a
direction and at such a height that he could
skim low over the water craft&rsquo;s radio mast and
come almost to stalling speed while Sandy cast
the note overside.</p>
<p>Dick, who had caught up Larry&rsquo;s abandoned
binoculars, saw as they zoomed and climbed that
a sailor had rescued the note before it bounded
over the cabin roof and deck into the sea.</p>
<p>At once the hydroplane was manned and sent
away, the yacht took up its own course, and Mr.
Everdail&mdash;to give him his own claimed title&mdash;pointed
the airplane&rsquo;s nose for his estate. Sandy
occupied the time of the flight by trying to piece
together the strangely mixed jig-saw bits of
their puzzle&mdash;or was it only one puzzle?</p>
<p>By the time they sighted the hangar and field,
he had all the bits joined perfectly. Sandy&rsquo;s
solution fitted every point that he knew, and was
so &ldquo;water tight&rdquo; and so beautiful that he landed
with his face carrying its first really satisfied,
and exultant grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The beautiful part of it, to Sandy, was that he
could sit by and watch, do nothing, except &ldquo;pay
out rope and let them tie themselves up in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Sandy&rsquo;s suspects would certainly incriminate
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them guy me and call me &lsquo;Suspicious
Sandy,&rsquo;&rdquo; he murmured as he followed Dick toward
the wharf on the inlet by the shore of the
estate. &ldquo;If I untangle this snarl the way I expect
to, I may not bother to go in for airplane
engineering. There might be as much money
in a private detective office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. &ldquo;Everdail&rdquo; proceeded at once to tie himself
in his first knot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;hm-m!&rdquo; he remarked to Dick, &ldquo;feels
good to be on the old place again. First time
I&rsquo;ve set foot on it for three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he told us, on the beach, he&rsquo;d been here
this morning,&rdquo; Sandy whispered to himself.</p>
<p>He decided to pay out another bit of rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Everdail will be glad you&rsquo;re here when
she lands,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>The man whirled, frowning, hesitated and
then spoke very emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, boys,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
say a word to her about me! I won&rsquo;t be here
when she lands&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t want it known I&rsquo;m
in the East. There&rsquo;s a good reason&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet there is!&rdquo; Sandy said to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">JEFF ENCOUNTERS A &ldquo;JINX&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Turning with a confidential air and addressing
Dick, for whom he seemed to have the
greater liking, Mr. &ldquo;Everdail&rdquo; spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just thought of a good scheme. Has
Jeff&mdash;er&mdash;taken you into his confidence any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, helpless to interfere, heard Dick give
the substance of what they had learned from the
superstitious pilot. The man continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lets me snap right down to my plan.
Now we don&rsquo;t know where those emeralds are.
We don&rsquo;t know which people used the seaplane,
or whether the man who jumped has them and
has gotten away or not. But if I should fade
out of sight, and no one but my dependable Sky
Patrol knows I&rsquo;m around&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dependable Sky Patrol!&rdquo; Sandy
thought. &ldquo;Going to try to use us now.
Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;If no one else knows I&rsquo;m around&mdash;I can
watch and see a lot that others might miss.
I&rsquo;m going to have that seaplane brought here&mdash;and
then I&rsquo;ll be around, watching to see who
comes snooping&mdash;if anybody does. As I live and
breathe, I think that&rsquo;s a great idea, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick agreed readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. You can tell your other comrade&mdash;Larry,
you said you call him, Dick. I&rsquo;ll
leave a note for Jeff. Now I&rsquo;ll go on up to the
house and write it and make a couple of telephone
calls&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll drop out of things&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ll hear from me off and on till we get
those emeralds safe in our hands. Then&mdash;even
while we&rsquo;re waiting&mdash;if you can get your parents&rsquo;
consent to stay, which I think can be arranged
by Jeff&mdash;Larry can take some flying
navigation&mdash;you, Dick, can study engines and
construction, or navigation&mdash;whatever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a hand on Sandy&rsquo;s shoulder and the
latter managed not to wince or draw away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy can have the run of my library, full
of books on engineering and mechanics&mdash;and
you&rsquo;ll be learning while you help me get those
emeralds and find out who flew the seaplane and
who helped them on the yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I can get my father&rsquo;s consent to &lsquo;visit
you&rsquo; here,&rdquo; Dick said eagerly. &ldquo;And I like the
plan,&rdquo; he added heartily.</p>
<p>Sandy, watching their confidant stroll toward
the closed mansion, turned a cold face to Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine Sky Patrol,&rdquo; he grumbled.
&ldquo;You swallowed everything he said, like a big
softie! And told him everything you knew,&rdquo;
he continued, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Dick wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait till Larry comes and I tell him my
theory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Dick agreed cheerfully. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t start in earning your nickname all over
again,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you calling me &lsquo;Successful Sandy&rsquo;
before I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drone of an incoming airplane took them
racing to the landing spot where Jeff came down
to report that he had taken the unconscious seaplane
pilot to a hospital where it was declared
that he had a bad blow on his temple and might
not recover his mental clearness for many days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m done with this-here
amphibian,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Had more trouble than
I ever had before. I think the crate&rsquo;s hoodooed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the ghost haunting the hangar &lsquo;put a
spell&rsquo; on it,&rdquo; Dick chuckled. &ldquo;Well&mdash;don&rsquo;t,
worry, Jeff. You&rsquo;re down safe, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy shook his head. Let them take Jeff up
to the house, he decided, and watch the two men
when they met. Dick, not comprehending the
idea behind Sandy&rsquo;s headshake, nevertheless,
did not finish his sentence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The roar of a motor boat began to attract their
attention and as they went to the wharf again,
Jeff wanted explanations of how they got in
with the airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t make me believe Dick flew that-there
crate,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll find the
man who did up at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff swerved aside on a graveled path, leaving
them to aid the caretaker and his mechanic
to bring the hydroplane to its mooring and let
Larry jump out to join them.</p>
<p>They compared notes eagerly. Dick and
Sandy could hardly forego interrupting one another
as they brought their story up to the
minute after hearing how Larry had helped to
get the pilot to the amphibian, discovering and
rescuing the life preserver on the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Larry,&rdquo; Dick said, finally, &ldquo;Mr. &lsquo;Everdail&rsquo;
said we could take you into our confidence,
and he&rsquo;s probably telling Jeff everything. Suspicious
Sandy has a theory all worked out. I
suppose Jeff is a double-dyed villain, and this
Mr. &lsquo;Everdail&rsquo; will turn out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joking matter,&rdquo; Sandy spoke sharply.
&ldquo;You listen to my idea and see what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Jeff, the so-called Mr. &ldquo;Everdail,&rdquo; and the
pilot and passenger of the seaplane, as well as
the presumably injured man whom they had
not seen&mdash;all these were members of an international
band of robbers, Sandy claimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who jumped with the parachute
and life preserver must be named Gaston&mdash;from
what the pilot said to you, Larry,&rdquo; he
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must be French, maybe,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely he is,&rdquo; agreed Larry. &ldquo;But if he
was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get to that,&rdquo; urged Sandy. &ldquo;Well,
they learned, somehow, that Mr. Everdail was
in California and his wife was taking the emeralds
to London. They didn&rsquo;t have any conspirator
on the yacht&mdash;then&mdash;or else they would
have gotten the real emeralds long ago. So
there was just those five in the band&mdash;Jeff, Mr.
&lsquo;Everdail,&rsquo; Gaston, the man we haven&rsquo;t seen,
and the injured pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might have been two gangs, one of
three, one of two&mdash;or three bands&mdash;one of two,
one of two, one of one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t poke fun at him, Dick. He argues
reasonably so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Larry,&rdquo; Sandy was grateful. &ldquo;All
right, then, the band planned the work in London,
at the hotel&mdash;that&rsquo;s how Jeff knew the
emeralds were imitations they poured acid on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they carry acid just in case?&rdquo; Dick
could not restrain his tendency to tease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was something they meant to throw
on anybody who tried to stop them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-gracious! That might be,&rdquo; Larry exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, they discovered the false emeralds
and tried to destroy them.&rdquo; Sandy was more
confident at Larry&rsquo;s acceptance of his ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They managed to get somebody on the
yacht,&rdquo; Sandy guessed, &ldquo;and then to be sure
that there was no hitch, divided into three
groups&mdash;Jeff, possibly the ringleader after all,
in his airplane, two in the seaplane, the other
two in the amphibian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The confederate on the yacht was to secure
the gems, somehow, and they must have had a
radio somewhere to get messages,&rdquo; Larry was
beginning to see daylight and to concur with
Sandy&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sandy nodded, &ldquo;and they all went to
the appointed place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeff interfered with the amphibian,&rdquo; objected
Dick, &ldquo;and you forget to account for the
two men in the hydroplane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it came out the way it does in books,&rdquo;
Sandy declared. &ldquo;Each set wanted those emeralds,
and they tried to outdo one another&mdash;and
maybe the hydroplane was the honest one of
the lot, with Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s&mdash;the real one&rsquo;s&mdash;caretaker,
summoned by the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeff had us signal them,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must know Jeff,&rdquo; added Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how that fits,&rdquo; Sandy spoke earnestly.
&ldquo;The hydroplane men were honest, and
Jeff worked into their confidence and offered
to help them&mdash;to discover the plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Larry admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know what happened. Jeff signaled, but
he knew the amphibian was coming, and the
seaplane, to make sure neither would break
down and leave him helpless&mdash;while he supervised,&rdquo;
Sandy had good going now, &ldquo;the seaplane
got the life preserver, and then Jeff decided
that they might get away, tried to follow&mdash;and
while the seaplane was flying, its passenger
got the emeralds free of the life preserver,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re stalled,&rdquo; chuckled Dick, but
Sandy was not defeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The passenger, while they were high up,
threw something and hit the pilot, the seaplane
went out of control, the man jumped&mdash;and then
cut free his parachute, cut the sack holding the
emeralds, and hid in the swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t he take the rubber boat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be missed, Larry. He was too bright
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick! Wait till everybody was gone,
then take to the rubber boat, get himself picked
up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the boat isn&rsquo;t there when they bring up
the seaplane, I&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ve hit the nail on
the head,&rdquo; Larry conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! Here comes Jeff.&rdquo; Larry turned.
&ldquo;Well, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says you know all about him, but he was
gone when I got this-here note.&rdquo; He failed to
display the missive, to Sandy&rsquo;s disappointment.
It would have provided a fine chance to compare
the writing with what he had seen in the letter
supposed to have come from California. And&mdash;if
he was really flying East, why had Mr. Everdail
written? A letter, by mail, would be slower
than an airplane flight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this plan a-tall, a-tall,&rdquo; Jeff went
on, dubiously. &ldquo;That seaplane is jinxed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;pshaw, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, Larry. Listen&mdash;she cracked up
and her pilot got a bad smash&mdash;from something!
And&mdash;the emeralds vanished!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;We recovered the life preserver, anyhow,&rdquo;
chuckled Dick. &ldquo;And here comes the yacht so
we can return that much property. I tell you,
the Sky Patrol has accomplished something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff did not share Larry&rsquo;s smile. He imitated
Sandy&rsquo;s scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says for me to shove my crate in the
hangar, stay here, get your parents to let you
make a visit and Larry learn flying and so on,
but if I put my crate in that hangar&mdash;it haunted
and now the jinxed seaplane to come in&mdash;any
instruction I give will be at your own risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying,&rdquo; Larry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say&mdash;here&rsquo;s a queer one.&rdquo; Jeff changed
the subject. &ldquo;I notice them chunks of gum
wasn&rsquo;t in the amphibian! Did you take &rsquo;em
out when you stayed back in the hangar,
Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;or, if he did, somebody else put the
same kind in the seaplane.&rdquo; As Larry spoke he
withdrew from his pocket a dark, hard object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give that here!&rdquo; cried Sandy, snatching at it.</p>
<p>He tore at the hard substance with finger-nails,
working it flatter, and then, with an exultant
screech, boy-like but not good practice for
an amateur detective, he pointed to something
dark, green, glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of the Everdail Emeralds!&rdquo; he
exulted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">LARRY&rsquo;S CAPTURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever guess the gem was in the
gum?&rdquo; Dick stared admiringly at Sandy, exultantly
at the green light flashing from that
hidden emerald as Sandy scraped aside the
clinging substance from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First the gum was in the amphibian,&rdquo; Sandy
said, trying to be as modest as the discovery
would let him, &ldquo;then it was gone. We thought
we saw somebody in the hangar when first we
went in&mdash;but he got away somehow. Then we
saw the amphibian flying and it flashed over
me that whoever we had seen before had been
working on the amphibian and had chewed up
all those pieces of gum&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t see why he
had left it there. Then, when we found out that
the man calling himself &lsquo;Everdail&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t look
for or miss the gum, I guessed that he hadn&rsquo;t
been the gum chewer&mdash;but who had, then, I
wondered. And why. It must have been for
some reason, because if he had found the gum
when he came to play ghost, keep everybody
away from the estate by scaring them, and get
the amphibian ready, he&rsquo;d have throw any gum
he found into the waste can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;The gum was there for some reason,&rdquo; agreed
Dick. &ldquo;This is one time when being suspicious
has paid,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sandy admitted. &ldquo;When the life preserver
was found and no gems were in the oilskin
tied to it, and Dick showed me the gum,
the reason for the big chunks of old gum came
to me. The passenger had been getting it ready.
He had to chew a great lot to get enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t waste any more time,&rdquo; cried
Larry, eagerly. &ldquo;There are twenty-nine more
chunks in the seaplane. Let&rsquo;s fly there, Jeff,
and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That-there is good sense.&rdquo; Jeff started
toward the flying field. &ldquo;The fellow we didn&rsquo;t
find might come back for the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going with them, to help out, Dick told Larry
that he proposed to go at once to the various
airports and flying fields, to learn, if he could,
who had engaged the seaplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new Floyd Bennett field is the best
chance,&rdquo; argued Jeff. &ldquo;They have got water and
seaplane facilities there. It&rsquo;s on Barren Island,
and that&rsquo;s where a man could have gone, in
about the time between your seeing the &lsquo;spook&rsquo;
and the time the seaplane got where the yacht
was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for the yacht,&rdquo; Sandy said, accompanying
them. &ldquo;Mrs. Everdail will be glad to
see what I discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That gave each of the members of the Sky
Patrol something to do.</p>
<p>Dick had no difficulty in learning, when he
got the executives of Bennett field interested
that the seaplane was an old one belonging to
a commercial flying firm operating from the airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pilot who handled the control job,&rdquo; the
field manager told him, &ldquo;was a stunt man who
has been hanging around since he stunted on
our opening day. I&rsquo;ve questioned some of the
pilots for you, but no one seems to know who
the pilot had with him. A stranger, one says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That brought Dick&rsquo;s quest to a dead stop.</p>
<p>Sandy had even less success. Although in the
short time since his disappearance the supposed
impersonator of Mr. Everdail could not have
gone far, he was not to be discovered by any
search Sandy could make.</p>
<p>Farmhouses had no new &ldquo;boarders.&rdquo; The
house on the estate, searched with youthful vim
and alert thoroughness, revealed no observable
hiding places. Sandy finally gave up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The arrival, anchoring and debarkation of its
people by the yacht allowed him to meet and to
reassure Mrs. Everdail and Captain Parks.</p>
<p>Besides these two he met the almost hysterical
French maid, Mimi, also Mrs. Everdail&rsquo;s
companion and cousin, who had traveled with
her, a quiet, competent nurse and attendant
whose lack of funds compelled her to serve as a
sort of trained nurse for the millionaire&rsquo;s wife,
who was of a very nervous, sickly type.</p>
<p>In spite of everybody&rsquo;s relief when Sandy
displayed the emerald, the elderly trained nurse
and companion insisted that Mrs. Everdail must
retire, rest and recover from her recent exciting
experience.</p>
<p>Sandy, left alone, searched the hangar for
an unseen exit, but found none.</p>
<p>Landing the amphibian, at almost the same
spot they had set down before, Jeff looked
around for the rubber boat they had left tied to
a sunken snag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Sandy&rsquo;s ideas were right, after all,&rdquo;
decided Larry as he saw that the small water
conveyance was not there. Sandy had claimed
that if the missing seaplane passenger had hidden
during the recent search of the seaplane,
the boat would aid him to escape from the otherwise
water-and-swamp-bound place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the rubber boat&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Jeff commented,
&ldquo;the twenty-nine other emeralds of the thirty
on the necklace&mdash;they&rsquo;re gone, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to swim over again and see.&rdquo; Larry
stripped and made the short water journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still here,&rdquo; he shouted across the
channel.</p>
<p>Jeff, who had kept his engine idling, decided
to risk a closer approach in the amphibian
whose lower wingspan barely cleared the tops
of grass clumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there aren&rsquo;t any snags to rip the
pontoons,&rdquo; Larry assured him. To get closer
would save Larry many trips to and fro in the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Larry commented as the amphibian,
moving cautiously, came close enough for him
to catch a rope and put a loop around the closest
truss of the submerged seaplane. Thus he
was able to pass the chunks of gum to Jeff, who
had his clothes on and pockets for storage.</p>
<p>While the transfer was being made the amphibian&rsquo;s
engine died with unexpected suddenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-gracious!&rdquo; Larry exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
she&rsquo;s out of gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell by the gauge.&rdquo; Ruefully Jeff upbraided
his stupidity in forgetting to see if they
had to gas up before the take-off from the estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo; he wondered.</p>
<p>Larry, too, saw a number of difficulties&mdash;perhaps
more than did Jeff, because, from Larry&rsquo;s
point of view, due to Sandy&rsquo;s suspicion of the
superstitious pilot, Jeff must not go free with
the gems in his pockets, nor did Larry dare
be the one to go. If he did, Jeff might be playing
a trick, let him get beyond chance of return
in time, use some reserve gas and fly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swim,&rdquo; Jeff began, considering the
ways of escape to some place where they could
secure a supply boat with fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t chance swimming all the way
down the swamps to the nearest village on
shore,&rdquo; Larry said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This-here is a fix that is a fix,&rdquo; morosely
Jeff summed up the situation. &ldquo;Here we are
with a pocketful of emeralds&mdash;and no gas and
no way to get to any&mdash;and if anybody knows
the gems are in this gum&mdash;we&rsquo;d be helpless if
they wanted to take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry did not answer.</p>
<p>He was mentally going over the seemingly unbreakable
deadlock.</p>
<p>One thing that kept coming into his mind was
the strange fact that if the disappearing passenger
of the seaplane had taken the rubber
boat he had not also taken the hidden jewels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have known something about them&mdash;or
guessed,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;If they were put
in the gum while they were flying&mdash;unless it was
done while they were in the fog. But, even then,
he knew all that excitement meant something.
I don&rsquo;t understand it&mdash;he did know, because he
must have hired the pilot and the seaplane to
get the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, in that case, he mused, if the man had
known where the gems were, why hadn&rsquo;t he inflated
the rubber boat and taken them all, in the
first escape?</p>
<p>A possible solution came to him.</p>
<p>Saying nothing to Jeff he bent his whole
power of thinking on the more important discovery
of a way to get fuel.</p>
<p>Climbing onto the amphibian and dressing,
he considered that matter without arriving at
any workable solution.</p>
<p>His eyes rested for a moment on the upthrust
wing of the submerged seaplane. His face
changed expression. An idea flashed across his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do you suppose we could
make a gas line from the brass tubing on the
seaplane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;See that wing?&rdquo; he pointed. &ldquo;It sticks up,
and it&rsquo;s higher than our own tank&mdash;and if
there&rsquo;s a wing-tank, and I think a seaplane
would have them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?&rdquo; grinned Jeff.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if that-there is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carefully climbed out onto the amphibian&rsquo;s
lower wing till he could grip a guy wire
on the seaplane. By agility and a good deal
of scuffling with some damage to the doped
fabric of the seaplane, he got into the partly
sunken pilot&rsquo;s seat and from that, climbing up,
sent a quick glance over the cockpit, tracing the
fuel lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right as can be!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Now if I can
find a wrench and get loose some brass tubing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff, bent down in the pilot&rsquo;s seat, lifted his
head, shaking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Two might
push the crate down into the mud too fast for
safety. She&rsquo;s half a foot deeper in than when
we were here before. I&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Shutting off the governing valve, Jeff began
unscrewing the pipe lines, rejoining lengths of
piping until, with a section from the carburetor
to give the needed length, he passed over a
makeshift path for the wing-tank gas to flow
by gravity into their own craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; called Larry, bending the end
of the line so its flow went into the central tank
of the amphibian.</p>
<p>Jeff opened the gas valve under the wing-tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo; Larry was exultant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get enough to hop down the shore to
a fuel supply, anyhow,&rdquo; Jeff said.</p>
<p>The gauges were out of commission and they
had to figure the amount they secured from the
size of the pipe and time that the gas flowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s all&mdash;about seven gallons,&rdquo;
said Jeff as the last drops fell into their tank.
Larry threw aside the useless pipe, sent home
the tank cap and dropped down into the after
seat to be sure the ignition was off before Jeff
swung the propeller sturdily to suck the gas into
the cylinders.</p>
<p>So intent had they been on the business of
the gas transfer that as Jeff swung the &ldquo;prop&rdquo;
both were taken by surprise when a curt voice
came from close under the amphibian&rsquo;s tail assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your hands up&mdash;both of you! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>A man, coming silently from some concealment,
in a dory, undetected in their busy absorption,
held something menacingly businesslike
and sending sun glints from its blue steel.
Its hollow nose covered both at the range he
had.</p>
<p>Up went Larry&rsquo;s hands. Jeff, also, elevated
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; remarked the stranger, pulling the
dory around without losing his advantage,
&ldquo;both turn your backs and clasp your hands behind
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Larry, suddenly, earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give you the jewels without making any trouble&mdash;if
you&rsquo;ll let me put my hand in my pocket I&rsquo;ll
throw the emeralds down to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stared, amazed, either incredulous
or not quite understanding.</p>
<p>Larry had no emeralds and was well aware
of it. Jeff still made his pockets bulge with
the packed chunks of gum.</p>
<p>But Larry had seen a chance that they might
turn to their own advantage if once the man&rsquo;s
eyes could be diverted from Jeff. Just before
he had clambered onto the forward bracing to
spin the amphibian&rsquo;s propeller, Jeff had laid
down the sturdy wrench he had used for bending
the pipes; evidently he meant to transfer it
to his own tool kit but had wished to start the
amphibian&rsquo;s engine first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The wrench, within his reach, could be used
as a weapon. Larry had caught Jeff&rsquo;s flash of
the eyes toward it as his hands had been elevated.
From Jeff&rsquo;s expression Larry saw, out
of the corner of his eye, that the older pilot
caught the younger comrade&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the man had recovered his surprised
wits and was closely watching Larry.
&ldquo;Which pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one!&rdquo; Larry, carefully keeping fingers
spread wide, tapped one side of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the package or whatever it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s hand was quietly coming down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stuck!&rdquo; Larry began to tug, with his
hand in his inside pocket where he pretended
the jewels were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No monkey shines!&rdquo; warned the stranger,
watching closely.</p>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s hand flashed down, the wrench, with a
twisting, underhand fling, spun through the air.
Jeff dropped into the cockpit. The wrench
struck, hitting the man&rsquo;s arm and deflecting the
muzzle of his weapon as it exploded&mdash;but he did
not drop it.</p>
<p>In that split minute of time Larry was on the
cockpit seat&mdash;and plunged, in a swift, slantwise
leap, down upon the man in the dory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>His unexpected assault was executed so rapidly
that the man had not time to recover from
the surprise and get his weapon trained, before
Larry was on him, sending him sprawling backward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;my shoulder!&rdquo; the man cried out in sudden
anguish.</p>
<p>Larry, startled, seeing the pain in the face
just under his own, relaxed for an instant, only
being sure that his quick grip on the wrist holding
the weapon in its hand was not released.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the man groaned, and dropping his
weapon, he began to nurse his shoulder.</p>
<p>Larry suspected some trick, but there was
none. The man tamely surrendered. As he
nursed his painful muscles, a sudden misgiving
came over Larry.</p>
<p>The man, he recalled, in pulling with his arm,
had winced, before he got the dory where he
wanted it. His cry, his subsequent favoring of
his shoulder, told Larry the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man who was in the amphibian
when Mr. Everdail flew it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How did
you get here, with your injured shoulder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tide brought me through a channel. I felt
better, saw a spare dory and watched some debris
on the water and reckoned the tide would
get me to where I could see where the amphibian
set down. I saw it hop off the beach, saw
it disappear, heard it and saw it coming back&mdash;and
was curious&mdash;but how did you know about
Mr. Everdail&mdash;and who was in the seaplane, and
in the other crate I saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the tug and floating crane, to
salvage the seaplane,&rdquo; said Jeff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
to stay in the tug deckhouse, till we get the
straight of this&mdash;and for holding a gun on us.
You can explain to the police, maybe&mdash;as for us,
we don&rsquo;t need to explain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as later, he and Larry resumed their
places in the amphibian, Larry&rsquo;s captive remained
under guard on the tug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;POP! GOES OUR MYSTERY!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Before the lowered landing wheels of the
amphibian touched the private landing field,
after a flight delayed by the need of more fuel,
Larry saw his chums waiting by the hangar.</p>
<p>As the aircraft taxied to the end of the runway
he saw that their expressions were doleful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; Larry asked, climbing to the
turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our adventure is over and done with,&rdquo; Dick
said. &ldquo;It has gone &lsquo;poof&rsquo; like a bursted soap
bubble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeff and I have caught the man who was
with the one claiming to be Mr. Everdail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claiming to be,&rdquo; Sandy said disgustedly. &ldquo;I
was wrong. He <i>is</i> Mr. Everdail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came back, Larry.&rdquo; Dick chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came back? I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote the note for Jeff, and then called
up the hospital where the pilot was taken,&rdquo; Dick
stated. &ldquo;They said the man seemed to be coming
out of his sleep and Mr. Everdail went out
to the road while we weren&rsquo;t especially watchful,
and got a passing car to take him to the next
village. Then he took a taxi to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what he heard there made him come
home,&rdquo; Sandy added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the pilot say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recall what you thought was part of a
word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick&mdash;the beginning of &lsquo;Gaston,&rsquo; we
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry&mdash;it was a whole word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gast?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds the same, but if I spell it you&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly he spelled a word of six letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G-a-s-s-e-d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gassed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carbon monoxide&mdash;deadly fumes that blew
in from the exhaust of the engine&mdash;it was an
old crate, and the engine didn&rsquo;t have perfect
combustion, he said,&rdquo; Sandy gave the explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;The direction they flew,&rdquo; Dick added, &ldquo;across
the wind&mdash;the fumes blew into his cockpit. It
was set low, you know. Well, before he knew
what was what, he felt himself going. Then he
thought he could snap out of it, loosened his
safety belt, tried to lift himself for a breath of
pure air&mdash;the seaplane dived, and he fell against
something that knocked him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the passenger didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He didn&rsquo;t throw anything. The pilot
explained all that,&rdquo; Dick said, while Jeff formed
an interested fourth of the group. &ldquo;You recall,
Jeff, the captain of the yacht took out extra
insurance on the emeralds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that, too,&rdquo; Larry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English company became suspicious,&rdquo;
Dick went on. &ldquo;They sent a man&mdash;we&rsquo;ve called
him &lsquo;the passenger&rsquo;&mdash;to this side, suspecting
that some effort was on foot to hide the gems
or get rid of them till the insurance was paid&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a trick that has been worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;The
man from England hired the stunt pilot to fly
him out to meet the yacht&mdash;but how did he know
when it would arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Jeff. &ldquo;That English fellow was
that-there &lsquo;spook.&rsquo; Maybe he &lsquo;listened in&rsquo; on
the short wave set in the big house yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably it,&rdquo; Dick retorted. &ldquo;Anyway,
he flew out, and when he saw the amphibian
and the small hydroplane and our airplane,
he jumped to the idea that either one or more
gangs of robbers had somebody on the yacht to
get the jewels and throw them out, or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; urged Larry. &ldquo;How does the gum
fit in with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up to the
house and see what Mr. Everdail says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is Mr. Everdail, after all,&rdquo; Larry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his wife would know any impersonator,&rdquo;
argued Dick. &ldquo;So will Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the millionaire was genuine, &ldquo;in person
and not a caricature,&rdquo; as Dick put it, was evident.
Both the nurse, his relative, and his wife,
were chatting with him as Jeff delivered the
heavy packed ball made up of the gum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this-here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How does
this fit in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple enough,&rdquo; responded the rich
man, breaking the exhibit into its separate
pieces. &ldquo;The special agent from England, watching
here, had seen Jeff making his nightly hops
over from the airport. He thought, quite naturally,
Jeff was working with some jewel robbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t explain this-here gum,&rdquo; objected
Jeff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;This will. The agent from London thought
it likely that some attempt would be made to
get the jewels. He proposed to see whether it
would be made by professionals or by some one
working for me. He thought my wife or I had
the intention of robbing ourselves&mdash;making the
gems disappear until we could collect the insurance.
When he couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind which
was most likely&mdash;professionals or amateurs
hired by us&mdash;he thought of trying to get the
jewels&mdash;and that meant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A safe hiding place if he was followed, until
he could get to a vault and notify his firm,&rdquo;
Sandy broke in, eager to declare how mistaken
he had been by giving the true facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about the man who was with you?&rdquo;
Larry turned to Mr. Everdail, while Mrs. Everdail
with a little grimace of disgust, drew
Sandy&rsquo;s first discovery of the gem in the gum
closer to look at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of my divisional managers in the
transcontinental tourist airlines,&rdquo; stated the
millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better get him off that wrecking
tug,&rdquo; and Larry gave the story of the man&rsquo;s
appearance and capture, giving Jeff the credit
which Jeff, generously and promptly, returned
to him with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Everdail, &ldquo;here are
the emeralds, minus the chain, which can easily
be duplicated. And you know who&rsquo;s who, and
why the hangar seemed to be haunted, and all
about the gum. Is there anything you don&rsquo;t
understand?&mdash;before Larry starts taking flying
instructions from Jeff and you others join my
wife and I for a cruise to Maine where I will
leave Mrs. Everdail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Larry responded. &ldquo;We saw that
parachute the man in the seaplane had come
down with&mdash;the harness was unbuckled, so he
wasn&rsquo;t hurt in the drop. What I want to bring
up is this: why did he desert the stunned pilot&mdash;and
not appear when we landed there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; the millionaire was thoughtful.
&ldquo;I wonder what you would do if you had to
make a &rsquo;chute jump and then, after the excitement
discovered that the pilot was &lsquo;out&rsquo; and had
a blow on the temple&mdash;and with concealed jewels
in his cockpit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d hide too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why were the chunks of gum put in the
pilot&rsquo;s cockpit and not in the passenger&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
Larry persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting worse than I am,&rdquo; grinned
Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;The passenger was not an aviator,&rdquo; the rich
man retorted soberly. &ldquo;He put them where he
thought he would sit&mdash;in the wrong place, it
happened. So, when they got the jewels, it
was simpler to put them where the pilot could
hide them, where the gum was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another reason would be,&rdquo; Jeff said, &ldquo;pilots
use gum and it would look more natural for it
to be stuck around where he did his control job
than up forward, where the special agent had
it in the amphibian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that bothered me,&rdquo; admitted
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Pop! goes our mystery,&rdquo; chuckled Dick.</p>
<p>Mrs. Everdail bent forward, and then looked
up sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that?&rdquo; She turned to her
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atley,&rdquo; she said, excited and nervous. &ldquo;Look
here!&rdquo; The man almost raced around the library
table, bending close to where her finger touched
the dark green showing through the adhesive
gum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything&mdash;out of the way,&rdquo; he
replied to her look.</p>
<p>The Sky Patrol saw her expression and each
grew taut with excitement at her next words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She raised
her voice to a shrill pitch of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see one of the emeralds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that it is pitted&mdash;burned&mdash;by
acid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glory-gracious-golly!&rdquo; Larry was agitated
enough to couple all the exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the Everdail Emerald,&rdquo; the lady
was almost screaming, her hands trembled as
she pointed. &ldquo;It is the emerald that I had in
the hotel room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The imitation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Atley! Oh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned to Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just said, &lsquo;Pop! goes our mystery.&rsquo;&rdquo; He
had to laugh in spite of the grave situation, the
new development, as he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&lsquo;Pop!&rsquo; Here comes our mystery back
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bigger than ever!&rdquo; agreed Larry.</p>
<p>For once Sandy was absolutely speechless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE HOODOOED AIRPLANE</span></h2>
<p>After their exciting day, the next two weeks
proved more than dull to the youthful members
of the Sky Patrol.</p>
<p>Nothing happened to clear up the mystery.</p>
<p>To the surprise of the yacht crew, Captain
Parks kept them all busy preparing, the day
after Mrs. Everdail&rsquo;s dramatic discovery, for a
run to Bar Harbor, Maine.</p>
<p>That was unusual. After a trip across the
Atlantic, the yacht was ordinarily laid up for
awhile, giving its crew some shore liberty.</p>
<p>Captain Parks, however, agreed with Mr.
Everdail, who trusted him absolutely&mdash;if Sandy
did not&mdash;that it would be wise not to give any
person who had been on the yacht during its
crossing any chance to get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the run,&rdquo; Mr. Everdail told Sandy and
Dick, &ldquo;and while we lay over at Bar Harbor,
you two can watch for anything suspicious. My
wife won&rsquo;t let me say that Mimi, the maid, could
be guilty&mdash;besides, how could she get into Captain
Parks&rsquo; safe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think, myself, some man of the crew would
be the one to watch,&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;Maybe the
steward, who could have a reason for getting
into the captain&rsquo;s quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a woman Larry saw, through the
glasses, at the stern,&rdquo; Sandy objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;there&rsquo;s the stewardess who attends
to the ladies&rsquo; cabins,&rdquo; argued Dick. &ldquo;We
can watch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did, but no one on board asked for shore
leave, either on the day before lifting anchor or
during the stay in the Maine waters. Dick and
Sandy used ears and eyes alertly; but nothing
suspicious looking rewarded their vigilance.</p>
<p>Larry, staying at the old estate home with
Jeff, had some compensation, at least, for being
separated from his chums. Not only could
he keep an eye on things and be ready if Jeff
called for an aide; as well, he had his daily instruction
in ground school and in the air.</p>
<p>Already &ldquo;well up&rdquo; on all that books could
tell about engines, types of airplanes, construction
methods, rigging and even handling a craft
in the air, he got the practical personal experience
that is the only real teacher, and the thrill
of donning the Gossport helmet, with its ear
&rsquo;phones and speaking tube through which Jeff,
in the second place of the amphibian or the airplane,
instructed him, correcting faults or gave
hints, was a real thrill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>He learned, first of all, not to start up an engine
while the tail of the ship pointed toward
a hangar, or other open building, or toward a
crowd, in future, on a field.</p>
<p>The propeller blast threw a torrent of dust
and as Jeff told him, he mustn&rsquo;t become that
most unpopular of airport nuisances, a &ldquo;dusting
pilot,&rdquo; whose carelessness flung damaging
clouds on airplanes in hangars and people on
the fields.</p>
<p>Learning to warm up the engine, to check up
on instruments, to keep the ship level while
taxiing down the field to head into the wind, to
make the turn, either in stiff wind or gentle
breeze, so that the wind did not tip the craft
and scrape wingtips&mdash;these and a dozen other
things he acquired in several early lessons.</p>
<p>The second place of the airplane had been
fitted with a set of dual controls, rudder bar,
throttle and &ldquo;joystick&rdquo; so that Jeff, for two successive
hops, let Larry put feet on his rudder
bar and lightly hold the stick as Jeff manipulated
the controls and explained, by use of the
Gossport helmet, why he did this or that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Jeff believed, as does every good instructor,
that showing, and explaining, is necessary as
a first step, but that a flyer is developed only by
practice during which he makes mistakes and is
told why they are mistakes and how to correct
them, thus gaining confidence and assurance by
actually flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That-there time,&rdquo; Jeff might say, &ldquo;when the
caretaker &lsquo;playing mechanic&rsquo; and pulling down
the prop till the engine catches, didn&rsquo;t you open
up the throttle too wide? Better to open it just
enough to give the engine gas to carry along
on&mdash;and even cut the gun a bit more to let
it run fairly slow till it warms up. Turning her
up to full eighteen hundred revs don&rsquo;t gain
while she&rsquo;s cold, and it throws dust like sin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, as Larry taxied, learning to manage speed
on the ground by use of wider throttle for more
speed, cutting down the gas if the craft began
going too fast, he would catch an error:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you forget last time to put the stick back
and make the blast on the elevators hold the
tail down while we taxi? Sure, you did&mdash;but
you won&rsquo;t again, because you saw that if you
didn&rsquo;t we might nose over. You &lsquo;over-controlled&rsquo;,
too, and almost nosed over before you
caught it&mdash;and then, we were going so fast I
don&rsquo;t know what kept this-here crate from starting
to hop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;easy movements always&mdash;don&rsquo;t
jerk the controls&mdash;take it fairly easy. And
you are doing right to move the stick back to
neutral this time when the tail came up&mdash;kick
rudder a bit, isn&rsquo;t she slanting to the right?
That&rsquo;s it, buddy, left rudder and back, and now
the right rudder&mdash;there she is, headed right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mostly, Larry caught his own mistakes in
time.</p>
<p>Ordinarily cool-headed, he had to be told only
once or twice, and reminded almost never that
jerky manipulation of the controls was not good
practice or helpful to their evolutions. Easy
movements, continual alertness and a cool head
stood him in good stead.</p>
<p>Seeing those fine qualities, Jeff had Larry
thrilling and happy on the fourth day by letting
the youthful enthusiast for aviation take over
for a simple control job, straight, level flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to get the feel of the air, and
see how stable the average modern crate is,&rdquo;
Jeff spoke through the Gossport tube. &ldquo;How
does that-there wing look to you&mdash;kind of dropping?&mdash;remember
what I did&mdash;that&rsquo;s the stuff,
stick to the left a bit and back to neutral, so the
other wing won&rsquo;t drop! No use teetering back
and forth. They put neutral position into a
control so you can set ailerons or rudder or elevators
where you want them and hold them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>There was more than Larry had ever dreamed
there would be to keep in mind: there was the
maintaining of level flight; even in his simplest
personal contact with the controls; then there
was the job of keeping the horizon line at the
right location by watching past a chosen spot on
the engine cowling, else they would start to
climb or go into a glide. There was the real
horizon to distinguish from the false horizon,
which an airman knows is, through some trick
of the air, the visible horizon that is just a little
bit above the true horizon, so that to hold level
flight in a forward direction, that false horizon
is not held on a line with the top of the engine
cowling, but, to hold a line with the true horizon
the marking point is held just a trifle below that
false, visible horizon line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Had that been all he had to comprehend
Larry&rsquo;s first control job would have been
simple. There was much more to watch&mdash;the
tachometer, to keep track of engine speed; the
air speed was learned by watching the indicator
on the wing of that particular type of airplane;
the position of the nose with relation to the
horizon had to be constantly noted and a tendency
to rise or lower had to be corrected: little
uprushes or warm air made the airplane tilt a
trifle to one side or the other and ailerons had
to be used to bring it back, the stick had to be
returned to neutral gently at exactly the point
of level flight after such correction and not sent
to the other side or the craft tipped the other
way and opposite aileron had to be applied;
then there was the chosen point such as a church
steeple, tall tree or other landmark selected as
a point on the course to hold the nose on&mdash;that
must be watched and a touch of rudder given if
the craft deviated from its straight line.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, complicated as flying appeared
to be on that first handling of joystick, rudder
and throttle, Larry knew that the happiest time
of his life would be his first successful solo hop,
and that the complicated look of the maneuvers
and the number of things to watch&mdash;level flight,
direction, maintaining flying speed, seeing that
altitude was maintained, that his own craft was
not menacing or menaced by any other in the air,
all these would become simple, second nature as
soon as the flying hours piled up and gave him
more skill and experience.</p>
<p>Morning and afternoon Jeff took him up.</p>
<p>Quick to learn, retentive of memory, not repeating
the same mistakes&mdash;even working out
some points for himself&mdash;Larry, at the end of
the fifth day, was gratified to have Jeff, as he
slipped off the Gossport, tell him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only trouble about this-here instruction
is that I&rsquo;m scared you&rsquo;re going to make a better
pilot than your teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks&mdash;but I never could be any better
than you, Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can,&rdquo; the older man&rsquo;s face became
doleful. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t the kind to let that-there
superstition bug bite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted his pupil. &ldquo;I think superstition
is just believing something somebody
else tells you until you are so busy watching
out for something to go wrong that you aren&rsquo;t
&lsquo;right on the job&rsquo; with your own work&mdash;or you
are so busy waiting for some good thing to &lsquo;happen&rsquo;
that you don&rsquo;t see Opportunity when it
comes up because you&rsquo;re not watching Opportunity&mdash;you&rsquo;re
watching Luck, or Omens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it!&rdquo; Jeff was rueful. &ldquo;I want
to kick myself sometimes&mdash;but when you know
other folks has had their crates &lsquo;jinxed&rsquo; by being
in the same hangar with one that has got the
name for being hoodooed&mdash;what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;m doing now,&rdquo; Larry grinned.
&ldquo;I know Mr. Everdail paid the company for the
ruined seaplane and moved it into the hangar,
here. I know your airplane almost touches it,
every night. But I don&rsquo;t let that worry me,
because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it worries me. I try not to let it, but
the worry is there, no matter what I do. You
see, I never thought, out in the marsh, about
anything going wrong because I took that big
wrench and put it in my tool kit after we salvaged
it out of the water. But I dreamt about
emeralds, last night, and so I went to a fortune
teller gypsy woman and she told me a dream
like that meant bad luck in business, and so I
said I was a pilot and told her all about the
seaplane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be careful,&rdquo; Larry interrupted.
&ldquo;If she puts two-and-two together, emeralds
and a chase and a wrecked seaplane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she was too busy talking to listen that
close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re awfully quick&mdash;the way they guess
what&rsquo;s in your mind proves that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t think anything about it. Anyhow,
she told me not on any chance to touch that
cracked up seaplane or anything that ever was
on it&mdash;and so&mdash;I put the jinx on my own crate
without meaning to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still willing to learn in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it worries me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother me, Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t, for several more busy days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;HOODOO&rdquo; STRIKES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sandy! How are you, Dick?&rdquo; Larry
met the returning chums as they climbed to the
small estate wharf from the yacht tender, and
while they strolled up the path he asked eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new? Anything suspicious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even our Sandy could discover a thing,&rdquo;
Dick confided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those emeralds aren&rsquo;t on the yacht,&rdquo; Sandy
declared. &ldquo;Captain Parks helped us by sending
most of the crew ashore while Mr. Everdail
took his wife to their woods camp. We
went over the yacht&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a fine-tooth comb!&rdquo; Dick broke in. &ldquo;We
did make one big discovery, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry turned toward him quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick tried to conceal the twinkle in his eye,
but it got the better of him as he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found a string of beautiful, perfect emeralds
in the stewardess&rsquo; cabin, hung up on a nail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Positive-ully, Larry! The finest that ever
came out of a ten-cent store!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy suspected her right away!&rdquo; went on
the jovial one, &ldquo;but no arrest was made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you discovered?&rdquo; Sandy asked
Larry quickly, to cover his impulse toward assaulting
the teasing chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing&mdash;except I learned that the injured
pilot was able to sit up and I went to see
him.&rdquo; Dick and Sandy waited anxiously for a
revelation, but Larry was unable to give one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is named Tommy Larsen,&rdquo; Larry informed
them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting well fast. He was
glad that his passenger had been wrong in suspecting
the Everdails&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell him the emeralds we found
were the imitations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sandy. He thinks they were the real
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say to explain about his passenger
not helping him, and then taking the
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man came while I was there,&rdquo; Larry told
Dick. &ldquo;He is named Deane, and he&rsquo;s a nice-looking,
quiet chap. It seems that when he
landed with his &rsquo;chute, he came down and struck
some driftwood or an old log, and it knocked
the wind out of him. When he got back strength
to cut himself loose, he tried to get to the seaplane
but his landing, as I explained the location&mdash;well,
you saw it when you flew over&mdash;his
landing was made a couple of hundred yards
away. I got the gardener to take me to the
place, yesterday, in the hydroplane. There was a
big, sunken log close to the torn &rsquo;chute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see you, that day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He tried to swim over, turned sick,
crawled onto some mud that was out of water
and stayed there. I guess he fainted. When he
managed to get there, we had taken Tommy
Larsen away&mdash;so he&rsquo;s cleared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;Sandy! We left with the pilot&mdash;I
mean, Jeff did. Then the hydroplane came for
me, and when he got there, afterward, don&rsquo;t you
see that if he was guilty of anything, he&rsquo;d have
taken the chewing gum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have seen that one chunk was gone,
suspected that the hiding place was discovered
and left the rest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicious Sandy!&rdquo; Dick laughed. &ldquo;With
twenty-nine lovely emeralds to recover&mdash;and a
rubber boat to get away in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! All right! He&rsquo;s an innocent man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;As innocent as the man I helped capture&mdash;Mr.
Everdail&rsquo;s friend, that man we put on the
wrecking tug for five hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody is innocent,&rdquo; declared Dick.
&ldquo;Sandy, my advice to you, for your birthday,
tomorrow, is to turn over a new leaf and instead
of looking for people to suspect, try to
think where those emeralds can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not on the yacht, you say,&rdquo; Larry
said to take away the sting to Sandy&rsquo;s pride.
&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t in the old house. They were taken
from the captain&rsquo;s safe&mdash;where did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me who knew the way to get into the
captain&rsquo;s safe and I&rsquo;ll try to get the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Parks says no one ever was told
that combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dick,&rdquo; Sandy replied to the chum
who had just spoken. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve answered Larry&rsquo;s
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-glory-gracious! It does look that
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could be safer? <i>He</i> says the emeralds
were gone and <i>his word is his bond! Oh,
yes!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the emeralds won&rsquo;t be found,&rdquo; concluded
Dick. &ldquo;Captain Parks has been ashore,
and away, hours at a time, here and in Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if Mr. Everdail won&rsquo;t listen to us
about that, now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s suggestion was followed.</p>
<p>The millionaire listened gravely to their
statement and broke into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
members of Jeff&rsquo;s Sky Patrol are working for
the wrong side. You ought to be with that London
lad, who suspects my wife and her cousin,
Miss Serena, and me! Oh&mdash;this is great! You&rsquo;re
helping me a whole lot. I think I must increase
the allowances for Suspicious Sandy, Detective
Dick and&mdash;er&mdash;Follow-the-Leader Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his frowning lips and smiling eyes
on the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed at you, though. Jeff says you&rsquo;ve
got good judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Parks had opportunity&mdash;he knew
you would take his word&mdash;no one else knew his
safe combination. Isn&rsquo;t that common sense, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of sense that&rsquo;s common enough&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could get the emeralds?&rdquo; persisted
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see. Besides Captain Parks,
there&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; his voice trailed off; once he shook
his head at some thought; once he scowled;
finally he shook his head defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe&mdash;it looks&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t
believe it! Not Billy Parks. He&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; Larry said. &ldquo;We thought we
ought to report what came into our minds. But
we can&rsquo;t prove anything, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my boy. Watch him, trail him,
whatever you like. I&rsquo;ll give you each a thousand
dollars if you can prove&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we, unless we catch him&mdash;and the
emeralds are gone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millionaire swung on Sandy as the youth
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;let me finish. A thousand dollars if
you&rsquo;ll prove&mdash;Parks is innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, dismissing them as he greeted his
cousin, Miss Serena, who had declared that his
wife would be better off alone to rest in the
quiet camp in Maine. Miss Serena, with a will
of her own, had come back, determined, if the
rich man proposed to stay at his old estate, that
she would assemble a group of servants and
manage the house for him. The three chums
sidled out, neither of the three counting on the
payment of that, to them, large sum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s money we&rsquo;ll never get,&rdquo; said Sandy.</p>
<p>The others agreed.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s birthday dawned hot, but clear, with
a good, steady south wind blowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The rich man had not forgotten Sandy. A
fine set of books awaited him at the breakfast
table, a set of engineering books that he would
prize and study for many years.</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s remembrance, a radium-dial wrist
watch, and Dick&rsquo;s gift, the set of drawing implements
he coveted, delighted him. Jeff&rsquo;s
modest but earnestly presented &ldquo;luck charm&rdquo;
secured from his gypsy fortune teller was accepted
with a grave, grateful word&mdash;but Sandy
had hard work not to break into a wild laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, buddy,&rdquo; Jeff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s face grew sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is Friday!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely it is,&rdquo; laughed Larry, and then, in a
lower tone, he urged, &ldquo;now, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir! I won&rsquo;t go up, today, even if you
did plan to surprise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would spoil it!&rdquo; Larry was unable
to keep from being annoyed, almost angry, because
Jeff had spoiled a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well tell you, Sandy, now that
it&rsquo;s &lsquo;all off&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;We were going to
give you another present&mdash;a hop over your own
house in Flatbush&mdash;with Larry for pilot!
But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind Jeff. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Jeff,&rdquo; Mr. Everdail chided the
pilot. &ldquo;Check over everything and then go up.
You know mighty well that accidents don&rsquo;t come
from &lsquo;hoodoos&rsquo;. They come from lack of precaution
on the pilot&rsquo;s part. The weather charts
for today give perfect flying weather. The airplane
is in fine shape. Go ahead&mdash;give the lads
a treat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your heads be it!&rdquo; Jeff said somberly.</p>
<p>He did not neglect his duty. For all his nonsense
about omens and such things, he gave the
airplane a careful checkup, warmed up the engine
for Larry himself and made sure that
everything he could foresee was provided for.</p>
<p>Sandy, thrilled at the prospect of a hop with
his own comrade doing the control job, was full
of fun and jokes.</p>
<p>Dick, no less eager to see Larry perform his
new duties, wasn&rsquo;t behind Sandy in good humor.</p>
<p>Larry, though quiet, was both confident and
calm.</p>
<p>He did not forget to assure himself, by a final
look at the windsock indicating the wind direction,
that the breeze had not shifted.</p>
<p>Neither did he &ldquo;dust&rdquo; the hangar, nor lose his
straight course as he taxied across the field at
an angle to turn, without scraping wings or digging
up turf with the tail skid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>A final test, with chocks under the wheels,
the signal for the wheels to be cleared by the
caretaker, a spurt of the gun for several seconds
to get the craft rolling as the elevators were
operated to lift the tail free, a run at increasing
speed, picked up quickly because of the
short runway&mdash;stick back, lifting elevators so
the propeller blast drove the tail lower and the
nose higher&mdash;and they left the ground.</p>
<p>Stick back from neutral, after leveling off for
a bare two seconds to regain flying speed,
and they climbed, the engine roaring, Jeff nodding
but making no comment through the speaking
tube he still used. Dick shouted a hurrah!
Sandy joined him.</p>
<p>Over the hangar they rose, and Larry, holding
a more gentle angle to avert a stall, continued
upward until his altimeter gave him a
good five hundred feet.</p>
<p>Then, choosing a distant steeple as in direct
line with the course he would fly toward Brooklyn,
to be out of any airline around the airports,
he made a climbing turn, steadied the
craft, straightening out, went two thousand feet
higher to be doubly safe&mdash;and drew back his
throttle to cruising speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says this airplane is hoodooed?&rdquo;
shouted Sandy, jubilantly.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;the hoodoo struck!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">DICK HANDLES A CONTROL JOB</span></h2>
<p>Flying close to three thousand feet above
Oyster Bay, level and stable, the airplane
seemed to be in perfect condition.</p>
<p>Jeff, for all his superstition, would have given
it as a pilot&rsquo;s opinion that only some mistake
on Larry&rsquo;s part, or a quitting engine, leaving
them with a dead stick, could cause danger.</p>
<p>Just the same the unexpected happened!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where President Roosevelt lies,&rdquo;
Dick, in the last seat, because their places were
rearranged by Larry&rsquo;s position as pilot, indicated
to Sandy, just ahead of him, the cemetery
beneath them.</p>
<p>Very tiny, in its iron fenced enclosure, the
last resting place of a national idol, was almost
invisible with its simple headstone; but Dick&rsquo;s
statement was understood by Sandy to mean the
location more than the exact spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Jeff to ask Larry to spiral down for
a better look,&rdquo; Sandy decided.</p>
<p>He transmitted the suggestion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy wants to see President Roosevelt&rsquo;s
place in the cemetery,&rdquo; Jeff spoke into the tube
of the Gossport helmet Larry still used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, just off our left wing, buddy.
That&rsquo;s right&mdash;stick goes to the left and a touch
of left rudder, but when you moved the stick
sidewise to adjust the ailerons you neglected
that-there bit of forward movement to tip us
down into a glide. Remember, it&rsquo;s the double
use of the stick that works ailerons and elevators
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry had overlooked that point for the instant.
It was his only difficulty in flying, to recollect
always to control all the different movements
together. The joystick, operating the
wing-flap ailerons by the left-or-right, lateral
movement, also raised or depressed the elevators
by forward-or-backward movement. However,
in any lateral position, the forward and
backward set of the stick worked the elevators
and in executing a control maneuver, even as
simple as going into a bank combined with a
turning glide, or downward spiral, the movement
of the stick should be both slightly sidewise,
for sufficient bank, and, with the same
movement, slightly forward, for depressing the
nose into a glide, returning the stick from
slightly forward back to neutral to avoid over-depressing
the nose into too steep a glide; if
not put back in neutral when the right angle was
attained, the depressed elevators would continue
to turn the forward part of the craft more
steeply downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not too steep, Larry. Back with the stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at the instant that Larry was about to
obey Jeff&rsquo;s instruction a gust of air, coming
up warm, tilted the lifted wing more, and as he
corrected for that, trying to get the wing up
and the nose higher for a flatter spiral, his
movement was a little too sharp, and the sensitive
controls, working perfectly, but too sharply
handled, sent the craft into an opposite bank,
rolling it like a ship in the trough of a sidewise
wave.</p>
<p>Also, Larry meant to try to draw the stick
backward at the same time, coordinating both
corrections; but Jeff, a little less calm than
usual because of the superstitious fears that
kept riding him, neglected to speak the words
by which he would inform Larry that <i>he</i> was
&ldquo;taking over&rdquo; until the correction was made.</p>
<p>By that neglect, both drew back on the stick
at the identical instant, and the nose came up
much too sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Larry, not aware that Jeff meant to handle the
job, almost pulled the stick away from Jeff in
his anxiety to get the nose down again, and
Dick, in the last seat, thought he felt a sort
of thud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands off! I&rsquo;ll take over!&rdquo; Jeff said tardily.</p>
<p>He drew back on the stick for, with the
throttle rather wide&mdash;because Larry had feared
a stall as the nose went up and had thrust the
throttle control sharply forward&mdash;the craft began
to go down in a very steep glide, not quite
a dive, but with engine on full gun, sending it
in a sharp angle toward earth.</p>
<p>Naturally, when he pulled back on the stick
and it did not yield, Jeff shouted through the
speaking tube, &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; for he thought Larry
had lost his head and was fighting his control.</p>
<p>Larry was not doing anything. He had removed
his hand from the stick, his feet merely
touched the rudder bar.</p>
<p>Jeff called out something.</p>
<p>They did not realize his words, but Sandy saw
his expression.</p>
<p>Almost as though he had been able to hear,
Sandy knew Jeff&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jinx has got us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff cut the gun swiftly, and came out of the
bank pointed toward the wide, shimmering
waters of Oyster Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Larry swung his head
to call back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stick&rsquo;s jammed!&rdquo; Jeff grunted through the
tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jammed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck. It won&rsquo;t come back. It&rsquo;s the jinx!
Hoodoo! We&rsquo;re heading down for the bay and
I can&rsquo;t get the nose up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, from the back place, saw Jeff struggling
with the stick.</p>
<p>If he did not hear, at least his flying study informed
him that something had gone amiss.</p>
<p>Equally, his quick mind arrived at a good
guess at the trouble.</p>
<p>The only reason Jeff would swing toward the
water and give up working with the stick must
be that the stick would not operate the elevators.</p>
<p>And that, to Dick, spelled disaster.</p>
<p>Its speed accelerated at the start by the engine
the airplane picked up speed rapidly because
its nose was steadily going down.</p>
<p>Jeff tugged madly again.</p>
<p>The stick, part of an installed auxiliary control
for instruction work, snapped out of its bed.</p>
<p>Jeff flung it disgustedly out to the side.</p>
<p>Larry sat quietly, knowing well that in no
time they would be diving toward a wet, deep
bay&mdash;and the end!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Sandy, not fully aware of the situation, but
tense, thought of his &rsquo;chute, in the seat-pack.
Would there be time? Could he use it? He
waited, watching Jeff and Larry.</p>
<p>None of the three noticed Dick.</p>
<p>Seconds counted, he knew.</p>
<p>If the stick was jammed, it might be possible
to get into the fuselage. There he might operate
the elevator cable by hand enough to get that
nose up more, flatten the glide, maybe enough to
enable Larry, who alone had a stick, to swing
around and come down on land&mdash;somehow.</p>
<p>A crack-up would not be as bad, perhaps, as a
plunge, a dive into the bay!</p>
<p>Before his mind flashed the recollection that
in construction plans he had seen provision for
getting into the after part of the fuselage.</p>
<p>Not wasting a second, he was already free
from his safety belt, climbing with agile quickness
for all his plumpness, onto the fuselage.</p>
<p>It was a fearful risk.</p>
<p>Their speed sent them through the air so fast
that the wind was a gale there on the unprotected
top fabric of the fuselage.</p>
<p>With his cotton-stuffed ears tortured by the
pressure, with the fierce wind tearing at him,
Dick clutched the seat top as he tore away the
fabric flap covering a sort of manhole back of
his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Headfirst he plunged in, scrambling, instantly
beginning to seek the points where the control
cables passed through channeled guides at each
side.</p>
<p>He was in a dark, stuffy, closely confined
and narrow space, his legs hanging out in
the roaring gale, unable to see, half suffocated
by the fumes collected in that restricted area.</p>
<p>He found a cable with exploring hands.</p>
<p>He tugged at it.</p>
<p>It was slack. That told his feverishly acute
intelligence that it was the cable whose lever
did not operate. He had seen that Jeff, when
he flung the stick forward to try to free it, had
been able to pull it back again without operating
the elevators.</p>
<p>Almost as his hand touched the cable and
twitched at it, his other hand, as he lay with
his weight on his chin, face and chest, contacted
something else&mdash;a large, roundish object, feeling
like a spare landing wheel tire.</p>
<p>He knew as though the light photographed
the truth to his eyes, that this tire-like object
had moved, shifted, fallen onto the cable, wedging
it.</p>
<p>Instantly Dick pushed it into the center of the
small space.</p>
<p>Gripping the cable, he twitched it sharply
once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>In the dark, he did not know how close the
water was. He could not tell if his alertness
had been able to give back the use of the elevators
in time.</p>
<p>Larry, his hand idly on the useless stick, felt
it twitch three times.</p>
<p>Automatically he tested it. It came back, and
the nose began to come up a trifle. He did not
dare over-control. He had learned that lesson!</p>
<p>The water was rushing up at them&mdash;but the
stick&mdash;might&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Seconds to go!</p>
<p>He must not drag the ship out of that dive too
swiftly&mdash;a wing might be torn off.</p>
<p>But with his nerves taut, by sheer power of
his cool will forcing himself to work steadily
but not sharply, he brought the nose up, closing
his eyes to that wild nightmare of water
seeming to be leaping toward the airplane.</p>
<p>Jeff shut his eyes. Then he opened them
again. No use to try a jump, no use to do anything
but be ready if&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Sandy braced himself.</p>
<p>The airplane was flattening out!</p>
<p>Larry was operating the stick!</p>
<p>The nose came up steadily&mdash;with a fraction
of time to the good, they began to come out of
the glide to level flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Larry braced himself against the slap of the
wheels into the surface water. That might offer
just enough resistance to nose them in.</p>
<p>He must be ready to open the throttle and
pull up the nose&mdash;but he must not do it too soon,
or do it at all in his strained, excited state&mdash;he
might go too far.</p>
<p>Level! The airplane skimmed, it seemed to
Larry, inches above the slightly ruffled water.</p>
<p>Gently he drew back the stick, opening the
throttle carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-to-gosh!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that was
close&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had lifted the craft and headed for
home, he glanced back.</p>
<p>Two legs waved over the last cockpit place.</p>
<p>And in that ridiculous position Dick, a hero
upside down, came to earth at the end of
Sandy&rsquo;s birthday flight&mdash;on the thirteenth, a
Friday, as Jeff, white and shaken, hastened to
remind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you sure done some swell control job,&rdquo;
he told Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dick retorted, without smiling.</p>
<p>He turned to Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did the trick, Larry,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I
only loosened the cables&mdash;freed them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;What made them jam, I wonder?&rdquo; mused
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jinx!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned on Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said very quietly for him. &ldquo;The
jinx! The hoodoo. I think it&rsquo;s broken, though&mdash;in
fact, I know it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because.&rdquo; Dick began to chuckle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
thought of a sure way to break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Jeff was regaining his color and his
curiosity.</p>
<p>But Dick grinned and shook his head.</p>
<p>He knew the answer to the puzzle of the missing
emeralds!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">A TRAP IS BAITED</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you think the hoodoo is
busted,&rdquo; Jeff commented. &ldquo;Me, I don&rsquo;t care.
I&rsquo;ve taken my last hop in that-there crate. I&rsquo;m
shaking like a leaf, even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to your room and have a
lie down?&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
<p>Jeff decided that Dick had the right idea.</p>
<p>Dick watched him go along the gravel path,
watched him climb to the side veranda of the
big house, pausing for a moment to tell the
newly installed housemaid about his recent adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go get some lunch,&rdquo; observed
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; urged Dick, but said no more.</p>
<p>Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s cousin, Miss Serena, evidently
hearing the voices, came out on the veranda and
listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming out to &lsquo;make over us,&rsquo; as she
calls it.&rdquo; Sandy saw the elderly, stern-faced, but
kindly lady descend the steps and come rapidly
toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! My!&rdquo; she called, coming closer. &ldquo;What
is this I hear from Jeff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a little trouble,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;Somehow
the cable for the &lsquo;flippers&rsquo; got jammed, but
Larry got us out of the trouble like a born flyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Larry. &ldquo;After Dick guessed
what to do so I could work the stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only crawled back to loosen the cable.&rdquo;
Dick tried to make his exploit seem unimportant.
&ldquo;First time I ever flew around standing
on my head,&rdquo; he broke into his infectious gurgle
of laughter. &ldquo;Sandy, did I look like a frog
stuck in the mud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you looked like,&rdquo; Sandy retorted,
&ldquo;you did a mighty big thing, crawling out onto
that open covering in the wind, risking being
snatched off or slipping, or having the airplane
shake loose your grip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with Sandy,&rdquo; Miss Serena declared.
&ldquo;It was a very fine thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; agreed Sandy. &ldquo;He gave me
one gift for my birthday at breakfast. But just
now he made me a present of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did that for all of us.&rdquo; Larry put an arm
affectionately around his chum&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;A very fine thing, Dick.&rdquo; Miss Serena smiled
gently. &ldquo;Now you had better go and lie down,
and I&rsquo;ll have the maid bring up some hot cocoa
and something for you to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I need, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Sandy
told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better get this crate into the
hangar&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get the gardener and the caretaker
and push it in,&rdquo; Dick suggested. &ldquo;I always
get over a scare quicker if I&rsquo;m busy doing
something to take my mind away from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the lady agreed. &ldquo;I shall have
a good lunch ready when you come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started away, but turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What caused the&mdash;the&mdash;trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff calls it a &lsquo;jinx&rsquo;&mdash;a &lsquo;hoodoo&rsquo;,&rdquo; responded
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff is silly,&rdquo; she said with some annoyance.
&ldquo;There are no such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; Larry took up the argument.
&ldquo;It is not usual for a cable to jam. It
might break, but one shouldn&rsquo;t get caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Don&rsquo;t think for a moment, Lawrence,
that it was caused by anything but Jeff&rsquo;s carelessness,
because of his fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to get their lunch ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I play up to you all right?&rdquo; Larry asked.
&ldquo;I saw you didn&rsquo;t want to explain anything.&rdquo;
Dick nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did just what I wanted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get the airplane in. Then we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With others of the new group of servants they
took the craft to its place.</p>
<p>As soon as they were alone, Dick climbed up
onto the back of the fuselage, dived down into
the small space, while Larry waited an agreed
signal, in the after seat, and pulled his chum out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great snakes!&rdquo; cried Sandy, then lowering
his voice. &ldquo;How did that get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, emerging from the fuselage working
compartment, displayed a large, fat, round object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life preserver&mdash;from the yacht!&rdquo; gasped
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it get there?&rdquo; repeated Sandy,
stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff!&rdquo; said Dick, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; declared Larry. &ldquo;Jeff is a good
pilot. He&rsquo;d never leave anything that could
shift about and cause trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did it get there?&rdquo; Sandy reiterated.
&ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all thought it went back to the yacht,&rdquo;
Larry finished his sentence for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; said Dick, seriously. &ldquo;I know that
after Jeff brought it in, the caretaker in the
hydroplane took it out&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve seen it at the
stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this may not be the same one&mdash;we can
easily find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry hurried from the open hangar, followed
by his two friends. At a trot they went through
the grove and down the path, after Dick, dropping
the life preserver onto the after seat,
jumped down.</p>
<p>As soon as the yacht came in sight, they
stared toward the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; observed Larry. &ldquo;I see a
life preserver hanging in its regular place. This
must be another one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The one in the airplane, Dick argued, was
&ldquo;the one&rdquo;&mdash;and the one on the yacht was a substitute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why was it put there?&rdquo; demanded
Sandy.</p>
<p>Dick eyed him with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicions Sandy&mdash;asking that?&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to suspect anybody. Instead
of doing that I try to believe everybody&rsquo;s innocent
and nothing is wrong. I&rsquo;m going to let
you do the suspecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s turning the tables on you, Dick,&rdquo;
Larry grinned. Sobering again he turned back
to Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think Dick is working out something we
may be able to prove,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;I think I
see his idea. Captain Parks was the only one
who could open the cabin safe. He is a seaman,
and he would know that a life preserver isn&rsquo;t
bothered with except if somebody is overboard
or in some other emergency. Supposing that
he meant to help some one in America to &lsquo;get
away with&rsquo; the emeralds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would tie them to a life preserver and
throw them over where somebody he &lsquo;expected&rsquo;
could get them,&rdquo; agreed Sandy, with surprising
quietness. &ldquo;Only&mdash;a woman threw the life preserver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded. Sandy threw another clog into
the nicely developed theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, Captain Parks was on the
bridge at the time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That all fitted in, Dick asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am working on the notion that Captain
Parks agreed with somebody not on the yacht&mdash;to
get the emeralds. But he made up his mind
to get them all for himself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;So he hid them in the life preserver.&rdquo; Sandy
spoke without enthusiasm, making the deduction
sound bored and commonplace, although it
ought to have been a striking surprise, an exclamatory
statement. It would have been, Larry
thought to himself, if Sandy had made it. Was
the youngest chum jealous of Dick, displeased
because it was not his own discovery that led
to the hiding place of the jewels&mdash;if they were
right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought of the life preserver as a hiding
place?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>Sandy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where else?&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Captain Parks
couldn&rsquo;t get a better or safer place, right in
front of everybody and never noticed. If the
life preserver was thrown into the sea&mdash;it would
be recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it get you excited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dick! Why should it? I thought of it.
But I&rsquo;m not telling all my ideas, any more. I&rsquo;m
not &lsquo;peeved,&rsquo; but I mean to be able to prove
this before I accuse anybody again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can prove it&mdash;come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; declared Sandy. &ldquo;I noticed while
we were on the way to Maine that a new life
preserver was on the stern of the yacht. I saw
it hadn&rsquo;t been cut and sewed up, so the emeralds
couldn&rsquo;t be in that&mdash;or in any other one
on the yacht. And, when Dick made his discovery,
just now, I examined the one he found
for cuts and marks of being sewed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice any,&rdquo; admitted Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bang! Another theory gone up in smoke!&rdquo;
Dick was rueful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Larry commented, &ldquo;Jeff
didn&rsquo;t put the preserver in his fuselage, and
Captain Parks could open his safe and no one
else knew how, he declared! There are some
things I can&rsquo;t work out and I wish I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make whoever knows anything&mdash;er&mdash;let&rsquo;s
make them work it out for us,&rdquo; suggested
Dick. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bait a trap with the life preserver&mdash;leave
it where it is, get Mr. Everdail to call
everybody together, and we&rsquo;ll tell what we
found and what we think is in it&mdash;and see what
we see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly Larry consented. Sandy nodded
quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;BAIT&rdquo; VANISHES</span></h2>
<p>Simple and clever, Dick&rsquo;s plan appealed to
Mr. Everdail.</p>
<p>His library, that evening, made Sandy think
of a &ldquo;mass meeting of creditors or stockholders
who have been tricked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room sheltered a mixed assembly. Jeff
was there, and so was the seaplane pilot, Tommy
Larsen, and his former &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; supposed
to be a special agent from London.</p>
<p>Miss Serena, with the yacht stewardess, uneasy
but clinging close to the older woman,
made up the representatives of the ladies&rsquo; side,
while Captain Parks, his chef, mate, engineer
and their helpers and crew, with the caretaker
and all the new servants, filled one end of the
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know why there was so much excitement
as the yacht came in,&rdquo; Mr. Everdail
completed a long speech in which he told the
astonished gathering about the missing emeralds.
&ldquo;That is, those of you know who didn&rsquo;t
know before,&rdquo; he added meaningly, and went on
quickly. &ldquo;I decided to tell you because somebody
on that yacht was &lsquo;in cahoots&rsquo; with somebody
else, and if any of you know who it is, it
will be worth ten thousand dollars to you to
point out the right one and help me prove you&rsquo;re
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will start something!&rdquo; mused Larry
as many exclaimed, and others looked startled
at the disclosure of the large reward.</p>
<p>By agreement Mr. Everdail watched the
sailors and servants to note the effect of his
story. Sandy, without doing it openly, watched
Jeff. Larry&rsquo;s eyes covertly observed Tommy
Larsen and his associate and Dick noted the action
and expression of Captain Parks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one who knows something!&rdquo;
Larry decided as he saw the passenger of the
cracked-up seaplane bend forward, intent, but
without a trace of expression. He had the sort
of face that can completely conceal its owner&rsquo;s
emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered that Captain Parks has a
hand in this somehow,&rdquo; Larry determined, as he
saw the mariner&rsquo;s eyes shift. Larry followed
the swift, instantly changed direction of the
seaman&rsquo;s glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;He looked smack at the stewardess,&rdquo; Larry
added to himself.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s watchfulness drew blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff didn&rsquo;t turn a hair,&rdquo; Sandy murmured
under his breath. &ldquo;He knew all about it, of
course. But&mdash;just you wait, Jefferson-boy, till
Mr. Everdail &lsquo;springs&rsquo; the trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the sensation created by the large
offer was over, everybody looked suspiciously
at his or her own neighbor.</p>
<p>No one spoke.</p>
<p>The millionaire waited a decent interval for
someone to come forward, and Miss Serena
finally broke the spell of silence by saying,
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find out anything by that, Atley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; She spoke in harmony with her
name, pronouncing her words serenely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;the person who threw the jewels
off the <i>Tramp</i>&mdash;isn&rsquo;t here&mdash;and wasn&rsquo;t suspected
or seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; The rich man rose,
while Dick, Larry and Sandy almost bounced
out of their chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serena, explain that!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your wife&rsquo;s French maid&mdash;Mimi!&rdquo;
she said quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo; broke in Sandy, astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see her,&rdquo; Miss Serena replied to
Sandy while she answered the older man&rsquo;s
question in the same breath. &ldquo;But I saw a
glimpse of dress just afterward.&rdquo; Her expression
showed confident assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Serena!&rdquo; Jeff was stunned. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you was one of these-here detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a woman and I use my eyes,&rdquo; she responded
quietly. &ldquo;A woman needs only to catch
a flash of a dress to identify it. Mimi&rsquo;s maid&rsquo;s
outfit has a distinctive cap&mdash;and I saw her cap
just as she turned into the after cabin&mdash;I was
on the bridge. I went there immediately but
she had gone out through the galley door and
I could not locate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; her cousin demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no need. She had taken only the
imitations&mdash;the ones you found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she knew them,&rdquo; objected Dick. &ldquo;She
wouldn&rsquo;t throw over the wrong ones and she
couldn&rsquo;t get the right ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She threw over both sets!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>The Sky Patrol gasped in unison. So did all
the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she couldn&rsquo;t get the real ones!&rdquo; persisted
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not know she was throwing them
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another chorus of amazed exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain that,&rdquo; commanded the millionaire
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;did&mdash;not&mdash;know&mdash;that the real emeralds&mdash;had
been&mdash;hidden&mdash;in the life preserver
she used!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who put the real ones there?&rdquo; Larry spoke
abruptly in the astonished silence.</p>
<p>He did not need to have her reply. Captain
Parks was red and white by turns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hid them to keep them secure!&rdquo; he stammered,
turning toward his employer. &ldquo;I had no
wish to take them. I felt&mdash;sure&mdash;nobody knew
the combination of the cabin safe&mdash;but I
couldn&rsquo;t say that a clever man, some &lsquo;Jimmy
Valentine&rsquo; fellow, might not get in. So I decided
to hide the real emeralds&mdash;and what was
safer than a life preserver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While eyes were fixed on him, surprised, accusing,
unbelieving, he spoke haltingly to his
employer:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll take my word for it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millionaire hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you!&rdquo; Larry spoke earnestly, reassuringly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get them into the life preserver?&rdquo;
asked Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took off part of the cover, cut the rubber,
put them in, wrapped in oiled silk to make a
tight pack, then used some rubber patching
cement I keep for torn rubber coats or boot
patching, and with a hot electric iron I vulcanized
the rubber together and put back the
covering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there weren&rsquo;t any stitches to be discovered!&rdquo;
exclaimed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; Larry leaped to his
feet. &ldquo;We can restore the jewels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we can!&rdquo; agreed Sandy. &ldquo;And
Mr. Everdail can telegraph his wife to have
Mimi arrested&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she will have to tell who was her partner,&rdquo;
added Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you had better go and get that life preserver,
and we&rsquo;ll cut it open,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
Everdail. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s safe enough hidden in
the tail of Jeff&rsquo;s plane&mdash;&rdquo; He was baiting their
trap. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so surprised, Jeff&mdash;that was
what caused your &lsquo;hoodooed&rsquo; crate to go out of
control&mdash;but we don&rsquo;t suspect <i>you</i> of putting it
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, Dick and Larry had left the room by
the time he completed his sentence.</p>
<p>Reaching the hangar, with Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s
private key they opened the smaller door, and
used a flashlight to locate, reach and climb to
the tail of the airplane&rsquo;s fuselage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;out comes&mdash;why!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy saw Larry&rsquo;s dazed face.</p>
<p>Instantly they knew the worst!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A FIGHT FOR A FORTUNE</span></h2>
<p>Into the waiting assemblage in the Everdail
library plunged Sandy with a white, frightened
face and his breath coming in gasps after his
run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;gone! Mr. Everdail&mdash;the life&mdash;preserver&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone? That can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Everdail was thinking,
as was Sandy, that with everyone whom
they suspected, except the maid Miss Serena
had accused, present in that room, the loss of
the carefully hidden object must be impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you last see it, wherever you had
it?&rdquo; asked the man from London, cool and practical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before&mdash;the meeting here, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;We left it where Dick had discovered it&mdash;in
the fuselage of Jeff&rsquo;s airplane. One of us
watched, taking turns, all afternoon. Just before
we came in here we made sure it was all
right, and Larry, who has the longest reach,
pushed it in as far as he could get it and still
be able to take it out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could that girl, Mimi, have come back?&rdquo; Jeff
wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether she did or not,&rdquo; the pilot, Tommy
Larsen, jumped up, &ldquo;if the life preserver was
safe an hour ago, and gone now, it was taken
during that hour. Maybe within the last few&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think it was in the last few minutes!&rdquo;
Sandy declared. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t talk about the
emeralds being hidden in it until almost the last
thing before we went to fetch it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s search the estate!&rdquo; urged the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, everybody&mdash;spread out&mdash;&rdquo; cried
Jeff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get that-there girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; begged Sandy. &ldquo;Everybody will get
mixed up and hunt in the same places. We ought
to organize&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound common sense,&rdquo; commented Miss
Serena. &ldquo;But if you ask&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy guessed that she would have given her
opinion, if asked, that the search was useless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>She was given no time for the comment.
Leaving her with the white-faced stewardess
and the pilot, whose injuries prevented him
from being of much use due to his evident weakness,
the others, under Mr. Everdail, were
grouped into parties. Given a definite territory,
each set out, one group to search the grove
under Jeff&rsquo;s leadership, another to cover the
shore section, boathouse and boats, with Captain
Parks and his men in the party. Others,
under the mate and engineer, divided the rest
of the searchers to beat the further and less cultivated
woods on the estate and to walk the
roads, while Miss Serena gladly agreed to telephone
to outlying estates, and to the nearby
town to have a watch kept for any unknown person,
woman or man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Larry&mdash;and Dick?&rdquo; asked Jeff, as
Sandy ran beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Searching the hangar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was locked and all doors down,&rdquo; Jeff
grunted. &ldquo;Why waste time there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we thought, just at first, somebody
might have hidden the preserver somewhere&mdash;we
thought we saw somebody in the hangar the
day the mystery started, but we found no one,
so Dick thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go tell them to come and help me in
the grove. Don&rsquo;t waste time there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Sandy separated from the superstitious one,
as the latter rushed among the trees, muttering
that some omen had warned him of trouble.</p>
<p>As the beaters separated, and widened the
circle of their search, the sounds of calls, shouts,
voices identifying one another grew fainter.</p>
<p>Sandy, reaching his comrades, compared
notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve organized and started,&rdquo; Sandy reported.
&ldquo;What have you two found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Dick said dejectedly. &ldquo;We ought
not to have left that thing unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with a fortune in it,&rdquo; agreed Larry.
&ldquo;But we were so sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever got it can&rsquo;t be far off,&rdquo; interrupted
Dick. &ldquo;No one but Miss Serena and Captain
Parks&mdash;and we three&mdash;knew about the hiding
place until the last part of the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s lock up, here, and join Jeff,&rdquo; suggested
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the grove, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Larry moved to the small door.
&ldquo;The spring lock&rsquo;s set. The place is surrounded.
Nobody&rsquo;s in here&mdash;&rdquo; They were outside as he
made the last statement. &ldquo;Slam the door and
try it, Dick. All right. Come on, let&rsquo;s find Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The search took longer than they expected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>To all calls the thick grove gave back only
echoes.</p>
<p>Dick, rounding a tree, stumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry&mdash;Sandy&mdash;come&mdash;quick!&rdquo; He called
his chums in a strained voice.</p>
<p>When they reached him, in the dying glow of
the flashlight Dick trained on a body lying in a
heap, they identified the man who had been
warned by his gypsy fortune teller to &ldquo;look out
for a hidden enemy.&rdquo; He was lying at full
length in the mould and leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff!&rdquo; Dick knelt and lifted the man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&mdash;uh&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, while they held their breath, understanding
came into the dazed eyes, the breath
was drawn in, and Jeff struggled to a half-reclining
posture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; begged Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m sick!&mdash;I got a bang in the
solar plexus&mdash;I sent the rest of the men out to
the edge of&mdash;the woods&mdash;oh!&mdash;my stomach&mdash;to
beat in towards me&mdash;when I come around this-here
tree, somebody was waiting and poked me&mdash;oh!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then somebody is still close. How long
ago?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;know&mdash;I passed out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey&mdash;everybody&mdash;yoo-hoo!&rdquo; Larry cupped
his hands and began to shout in various directions.</p>
<p>The crash and call of the beaters coming in
began to grow louder.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, from the water of the inlet,
and yet in a muffled, unnatural tone, there came
the sputtering roar of a motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the airplanes&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s in the
hangar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sandy, it&rsquo;s from the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no boat out&mdash;the only boat with
an engine is the hydroplane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yacht tender&rsquo;s tied to the wharf,&rdquo; Dick
reminded Larry.</p>
<p>They raced down the sloping woods path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the guard&mdash;where&rsquo;s everybody?&rdquo;
Sandy shouted.</p>
<p>The men came running. They had scanned
the place by the wharf, and, satisfied that no
one lurked there and that the tender was secure,
they had gone further along the inlet coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s in the tender!&rdquo; Larry exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hydroplane, then!&rdquo; Dick decided.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming from the water-dock inside the
boathouse, now&mdash;there it is. Hey! You! Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seamen, the mate, Pilot Tommy Larsen, servants,
dashed up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened? What&rsquo;s the excitement?
The hydroplane&mdash;there it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their shouts came in a chorus of helpless
questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man the yacht tender!&rdquo; ordered Captain
Parks. His men tumbled into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t fast enough!&rdquo; objected Pilot Larsen.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fly that amphibian crate only&mdash;I&rsquo;m
too weak and dizzy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff&rsquo;s hurt, too,&rdquo; said Dick, desperately. &ldquo;I
guess they&rsquo;ll get away with the emeralds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t Larry fly the &lsquo;phib&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night? I haven&rsquo;t had any experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeff could go along.&rdquo; Dick took up the
idea eagerly. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you, Jeff? And tell
him what to do in an emergency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;sure I could! Not in the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; because
we don&rsquo;t know how much gas&mdash;the gauge
is out of whack&mdash;but we got the airplane ready
this morning&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t the night of the thirteenth
I&rsquo;d have said something about it long
ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget about the thirteenth&mdash;remember the
thirty emeralds!&rdquo; cried Sandy. &ldquo;Come on, all&mdash;help
us get that crate out and started. It&rsquo;s a
flight for a fortune!&rdquo; They took up the cry.
Dick and Larry ran off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Those of the servants and seamen who were
not too excited by the escape of the hydroplane
to hear, followed the Sky Patrol as they raced
through the grove. Jeff, supported by Sandy
and friends among the men, came more slowly,
still unwell from the blow in a tender spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Everdail could fly the crate if he was
here&mdash;he&rsquo;s an old war pilot,&rdquo; said Larsen, but
they did not wait to locate him. As soon as the
engine was warmed, the instruments checked, in
spite of the delay at cost of precious moments,
Larry donned the Gossport helmet, Jeff got in
behind him, Sandy and Dick, without waiting
for invitations, snapped their belts&mdash;the engine
roared&mdash;and they were off!</p>
<p>Larry was keyed up to a high tension; but
he had no lack of confidence in himself. Night
flying, of course, differed from daytime piloting.
But Jeff was in the second seat, with the
Gossport tube to his lips.</p>
<p>Sandy and Dick were in their places, ready to
observe and to transmit signals by using the
flashlamp&mdash;one flash, directed onto the dash before
Jeff so it would not distract Larry, meant
turn to the right, two meant a left turn, three
quick flicks would tell of the discovery of the
hydroplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Jeff was too upset to pilot; and since the
morning adventure he had no second control
stick; but he could give instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a light,&rdquo; Sandy said as the airplane
swung far out over the dark water. &ldquo;A green
light, but the hydroplane wouldn&rsquo;t carry lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they swung in a banked turn to circle over
the Sound, the green disappeared and its
place was taken, as it seemed, by red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; Sandy turned and gestured, pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; Dick located the tiny light well
below them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hydroplane must have its electric running
light switched on,&rdquo; Sandy mused, unable
to convey his idea, because Larry had the engine
going full on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the hydroplane,&rdquo; Dick decided.
&ldquo;He&mdash;whoever is in it&mdash;is afraid to run without
his lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three swift flicks of his own flash showed to
Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry, they&rsquo;ve spotted that-there boat,&rdquo; Jeff
spoke through the tube to the young pilot. &ldquo;Yep.
More to the left. That&rsquo;s it&mdash;both at the same
time! Stick to the left, rudder, too. Good boy.
Now the stick comes back to neutral. Hold her
as she is&mdash;better cut down the throttle a little
as we bank and turn to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus began their flight for a fortune!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">OUTWITTED!</span></h2>
<p>From their cockpits Sandy and Dick watched
the hydroplane. At cruising speed their airplane
made nearly three miles to the hydroplane&rsquo;s
one. Its mysterious occupant must know
that they were trailing him, but he held to a
straight course so that his lights were never in a
different place as their craft above swung to
show its observers the red and then the green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making straight for Greenwich, on the
Connecticut side,&rdquo; Dick decided, knowing a good
deal about the Sound ports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you fixed?&rdquo; Jeff spoke to their
youthful pilot through his tube.</p>
<p>Briefly Larry swung his head, nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be getting tired of turning to the left
all the time,&rdquo; Jeff suggested. &ldquo;Think you could
follow a sort of zig-zag, flying slantwise across
the course of that-there boat, then coming
around an angle and flying slantways back to
the other side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry nodded emphatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Here we go&mdash;to the right. Get your
eye on that Fall River Liner, coming up the
Sound&mdash;that&rsquo;s about the point of our first leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, touch of right rudder and right aileron&mdash;and
stick back to neutral. There! She&rsquo;s
level. Keep moving stick and rudder a bit, steadily.
Now she&rsquo;s banked and turning. Neutralize!
That&rsquo;s the ticket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! The nose is on that steamer. That&rsquo;s
it&mdash;don&rsquo;t let her swing off that point for awhile&mdash;and
watch that you don&rsquo;t nose down&mdash;that&rsquo;s
right, back a bit on that-there stick, up she
comes, stick back to neutral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus directed, and admonished, Larry managed
to give the airplane a swinging, zig-zag
course, so that its greater speed was used up
in the longer legs of its slanted progress, and
since the hydroplane did not try any tricks or
change its path, the Sound was being crossed in
the wake of the steamer by the boat and in a
corkscrew path by its aerial bloodhound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what is going to happen,&rdquo;
Sandy decided, as they crossed the course of
the hydroplane so that its two tiny colored
beams showed at the same instant. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll wait
till we get closer in to the Connecticut shore
line and then he&rsquo;ll &lsquo;douse the glim&rsquo; and leave
us with nothing to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Bending forward Dick began to rummage in a
compartment built in his section of the seating
space.</p>
<p>He believed that he could outwit any effort
to escape by taking advantage of the landing
flares, attached to small parachutes, which Jeff
carried as a precaution during his former night
hops to the old estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better cut the gun and glide down a couple
of hundred feet,&rdquo; Larry heard Jeff&rsquo;s voice in
his earphones. &ldquo;If he tries any tricks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed to himself,
as he stared down and saw the small, swift boat
open a vivid, glowing eye at the bow.</p>
<p>The helmsman had switched on its searchlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Dick wondered.</p>
<p>Jeff, warned by the trail of light on the water
below, took a quick look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be looking for his landing!&rdquo; Sandy
called.</p>
<p>Larry, holding the airplane in a moderate
glide, saw the beam glowing out beyond the airplane&rsquo;s
nose, felt that he was as low as he dared
be with land ahead, and drew back on the stick
to bring up the craft to a level keel, opening
the throttle as the glide became a flat course
about three hundred feet higher than the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s swinging the boat out to open water
again!&rdquo; cried Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes around!&rdquo; shouted Dick, unheard,
excited, as the beam of the hydroplane
swung in a wide arc from shore, heading once
more back toward Long Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going back!&rdquo; Sandy exulted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; Jeff spoke to Larry. &ldquo;You made
that turn without a hitch. With that searchlight
to guide you, I don&rsquo;t need to talk through this-here
thing any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry had no trouble following the boat with
the white beam as a guide.</p>
<p>It puzzled Sandy, and he swung around to
look questioningly back at Dick. The latter, unable
to see his expression, but guessing his idea,
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to find out what&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>As Larry banked and came around on a new
slant across the hydroplane&rsquo;s path, which
seemed not so true to the straight line as it had
been, Dick secured a parachute-equipped landing
flare, sent it over safely past the wings,
and watched the white glare light up the surface
of the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>To Larry&rsquo;s disappointment, they were so far
to one side and behind the hydroplane that the
flare failed to disclose its occupant.</p>
<p>He held up a hand, and pointed ahead, then
opened the throttle, came onto a straightaway
course over the hydroplane, rapidly overhauled
it and got well ahead. Then, cutting the gun
and gliding, as it came up under them, he signaled,
and Dick, waiting, ignited a second flare.</p>
<p>All four of the Sky Patrol members gasped
as the light blazed out.</p>
<p>Larry looked back at his companions,
amazedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;empty&mdash;nobody in it!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">A BAFFLING DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody had to be in that hydroplane,&rdquo;
Sandy mused. &ldquo;They were there to switch on
the light, to turn the boat, and to set it on the
new course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly he peered to the side and back, downward
at the water in the place where the first
landing flare had settled into the water.</p>
<p>Just a little closer to their position, should
have been the spot where the clever miscreant
might have abandoned the boat.</p>
<p>Sooner than that, Sandy guessed, the unknown
person could not have quit the hydroplane:
otherwise the turning from shore would
have continued and the hydroplane, instead of
proceeding in a straight course away from land,
would have swept in a wide circle, round and
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no life preserver in the boat either&mdash;so
that&rsquo;s what the mystery man used to swim
away with&mdash;Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s jewels!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Straining his eyes, he peered, looking for a
bobbing head, a round white object supporting
a body, as the flare died. Dick, arguing in much
the same fashion, stared from the other side of
the fuselage and gave a shout of elation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arm pointed.</p>
<p>Sandy prodded Jeff, and quickly the pilot,
much recovered, gave Larry his instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nose up&mdash;we&rsquo;re getting too low. Right! Now
a right bank&mdash;not too steep. Don&rsquo;t get excited.
That-there lad in the hydroplane headed her
outbound and then took to the water. Now we&rsquo;re
heading in&mdash;steady with that-there rudder&mdash;don&rsquo;t
try to jam her around&mdash;now she&rsquo;s all
right. Level off and hold her as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry obeyed all instructions, doing the work
as Jeff gave the order. Larry was rapidly growing
sure of his ability.</p>
<p>He fought down the excitement that wanted
to express itself in hasty manipulation of his
controls and kept a steady hand and a cool
brain.</p>
<p>Dick, scribbling hurriedly, passed a note to
Sandy, who read it in the light of the flash, and
then passed both paper and light to Jeff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Dick, recalling a wide, spacious cement-floored
parking space at a nearby bathing
resort, had suggested &ldquo;setting down&rdquo; there. As
he read the note Jeff shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous trying to land there!&rdquo; was the
note Jeff passed back as Larry flew the airplane
at just above stalling speed toward the
shore. Dick agreed. After all, there might be
automobiles in the parking lines, and the light
might be bad for Larry. Even using a power-stall
by which, with the engine going and a flat
gliding angle, the airplane could settle gradually
closer until it took the ground with hardly a jar,
the maneuver would not be safe, Dick admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes another &rsquo;plane!&rdquo; Sandy called
out, taking the flashlamp from Jeff again as the
older pilot handed it back. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s flying right
after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all located the drone of the other engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Larry!&rdquo; Jeff cautioned. &ldquo;Hold as
you are. That-there is our amphibian&mdash;and I
reckon the boss is doing the control job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amphibian, as they made out its pontoon
understructure, came fairly close alongside. Its
speed was almost identical with their own and
at first all four occupants of the land crate wondered
who was in it, and why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signaling!&rdquo; cried Larry, cutting the gun and
turning to observe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, buddy,&rdquo; admonished Jeff. &ldquo;Stick
to your job. Sandy or Dick will read the dots
and dashes&mdash;if he&rsquo;s using Morse code&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is spelling out something with his flashlight,&rdquo;
Sandy decided, as he saw short flickers
and longer dashes of light while the amphibian
kept a course within close range but at safe
wing distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; Dick passed forward his paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;G-i-v-e r-e-p-o-r-t,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sandy read, and as
he handed Jeff the note, Sandy, using his own
light, sent back the Morse code answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man swimming ashore with life belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with the beam directed in the path the
mysterious unknown must have taken, he tried
to show the occupant of the amphibian what he
meant.</p>
<p>Evidently the endeavor succeeded, for the
amphibian dived, and took to the water, while
Larry, directed by Jeff, swept around in a circle
out of range if the amphibian rose unexpectedly,
but within visual range of its maneuvers.</p>
<p>Watching intently, his comrades saw that the
amphibian kept on toward shore in a taxiing
course on the water surface.</p>
<p>A shout greeted the advent of an automobile
on a shore drive. As it swung around a curve,
close to the water, its bright headlights fell in
a sweeping line across the water&mdash;and picked
out a round, white dot bobbing, vividly lit, in
the rays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The amphibian was headed directly for it.</p>
<p>It went close, just as the swinging lights
swerved and were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop another flare!&rdquo; shouted Larry.</p>
<p>Sandy caught and relayed the suggestion as
they retained their swinging curve.</p>
<p>With the glare from the dropped light picking
out things in sharp silhouette, they saw a man
clamber out onto a pontoon and rescue the floating
prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wonder if that is Mr. Everdail&mdash;or
if it&rsquo;s somebody else?&rdquo; thought Larry, correcting
for a tendency of the nose to fall away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it is,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t get
away. He has the life preserver. But we have
superior speed. And a good tankful of fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at the gauge to reassure himself,
made an almost automatic correction of a wing
tip, pushing up in a gust of air as he saw that
his surmise about fuel was correct.</p>
<p>There was no need for the concern that all
four felt for the moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>As soon as it got under way again and took
up its climb, the amphibian, coming to their
level, showed its pilot holding up the life preserver,
as the flare still settled toward the
water. In the glow they recognized the triumphant,
smiling millionaire.</p>
<p>The flight back to the landing field was without
event. Larry made the landing first, and
his companions tumbled out to join the waiting
cluster of people while they all &ldquo;took hold&rdquo; to
run the airplane out of the way so that the spiraling
amphibian, its wheels down, could shoot
the flare-lit field, and land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Mr. Everdail was triumphant as he
threw the life preserver out of his cockpit to
Larry. &ldquo;As I live and breathe, that life preserver
ought to be in a museum!&rdquo; He grinned
as he came to the ground. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the flyingest
life preserver I ever saw&mdash;first it goes joy-riding
in a seaplane, then in the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; and now it
runs off on the Sound and comes riding back
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in that-there!&rdquo; Jeff urged.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most important, right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd trooped into the hangar, where
Larry, at Jeff&rsquo;s direction, switched on the overhead
electric lamps.</p>
<p>Close around Mr. Everdail, Jeff, Captain
Parks and Miss Serena, with the youthful Sky
Patrol in their midst, the rest of the sailors, and
most of the house servants gathered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody give me a good knife,&rdquo; ordered
Mr. Everdail. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut this thing to ribbons
and get rid of all the suspense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry held out the round, heavy inflated
&ldquo;doughnut&rdquo; as half a dozen pocket knives were
unclasped and held out to the millionaire.</p>
<p>Taking the long-bladed one Sandy produced,
Mr. Everdail advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, sir!&rdquo; Captain Parks stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Parks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, turn that preserver over&mdash;let me see
the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprised, Larry did as he asked.</p>
<p>They all saw the captain&rsquo;s face assume an
expression of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the life preserver from the
<i>Tramp</i>,&rdquo; he grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as well as I do, sir,&rdquo; the yacht
captain turned to his employer to answer his
amazed cry, &ldquo;you know that all the life preservers
have the yacht&rsquo;s name and port painted
on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s so, too,&rdquo; said the mate, advancing
and backing up his captain&rsquo;s declaration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sirree!&rdquo; Captain Parks stated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not the yacht property. It hasn&rsquo;t any marks on
it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the one off the hydroplane,&rdquo;
Larry was dejected, but not convinced that the
life preserver was a strange one to all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that!&rdquo; the mate declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ud be
marked <i>Scorpion</i>. No, Mr. Everdail, this is no
life preserver we&rsquo;ve ever seen before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, I&rsquo;m going to cut into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, do that!&rdquo; urged Sandy. &ldquo;I can
be sure it&rsquo;s the one we found in the airplane
fuselage, anyhow&mdash;I remember that little rusty
stain in the cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut,&rdquo; said Jeff, &ldquo;but something tells me
you&rsquo;ll waste time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, Larry and Dick shook their heads,
looking hopeful.</p>
<p>But Jeff was right!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">SANDY TURNS OVER A NEW LEAF</span></h2>
<p>From the rear of the crowd in the hangar,
Pilot Larsen came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was in that boat?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Could
you recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flares died just too soon,&rdquo; Dick informed
him. &ldquo;Maybe Mr. Everdail saw more than we
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millionaire shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one way to check up,&rdquo; Jeff suggested.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s not here who was in the house
before the life preserver was missed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can learn nothing from that,&rdquo; Miss
Serena spoke up. &ldquo;Too many are away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get somewhere, anyhow,&rdquo; Larry insisted.
&ldquo;Captain Parks, can you account for
your men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Those who are not here are in the
tender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them start to get back Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s
hydroplane,&rdquo; Sandy nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow who flew with you in the seaplane
isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; remarked Larry, quietly, and,
after a glance around, he said: &ldquo;Neither is the
yacht stewardess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent her to her cabin,&rdquo; Miss Serena stated.
&ldquo;She was greatly disturbed about this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Larry, slowly, &ldquo;she was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she is a high-strung girl,&rdquo; argued
the lady; and during the silence that followed,
she turned to her relative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atley,&rdquo; she told the millionaire, &ldquo;we are getting
nowhere. For my part I believe that the
emeralds have already been destroyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Destroyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. That seemed to be the purpose,
in the London hotel. A person as clever as that
must have planned this entire affair and has
undoubtedly accomplished his wish and vanished
long ago&mdash;or else he can never be caught
because we have no way to discover him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be caught and punished,&rdquo; Jeff
argued. &ldquo;That-there set of emeralds was too
precious for us to let somebody do a thing like
this-here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know who was on the yacht,&rdquo; Larry
agreed with Jeff. &ldquo;At least we can try to find
out who threw the emeralds off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; Dick broke in. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember
that Miss Serena recognized the maid&mdash;Mimi&mdash;by
her uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we go and question her?&rdquo;
Larry suggested. &ldquo;Make her tell what she
knows!&rdquo; A murmur of assent broke out among
the seamen who were naturally anxious to be
cleared of any possible suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get an answer from Mrs. Everdail
when you telegraphed her about Mimi?&rdquo; asked
Dick.</p>
<p>Mr. Everdail shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mimi
is the one. She was with my wife during the
last seven years and you get to know a person&rsquo;s
character in that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; Larry insisted, &ldquo;many respected
bank tellers have been discovered for
what they were after bank money disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; Mr. Everdail spoke
gruffly, &ldquo;I begin to wonder if you shouldn&rsquo;t be
the one to have &lsquo;suspicious&rsquo; for a nickname.
You have suspected Jeff, and me, and my friend
who was with me, and Larsen, here, and his
passenger&mdash;Captain Parks and now Mimi! It
will be Miss Serena next!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; that lady exclaimed, &ldquo;I hope
not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will,&rdquo; Dick declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I caught the disease from Sandy,&rdquo;
Larry was red-faced, &ldquo;I admit I deserve the
nickname now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Sandy doesn&rsquo;t object to losing the nickname,
then&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Everdail smiled a little teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s welcome to it,&rdquo; Sandy cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
turned over a new leaf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jeff wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to take one little thing for a start,
and make up my mind that whoever did it was
the one I must suspect,&rdquo; Sandy explained. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s like trying to prove a man guilty because
<i>I</i> think he may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Dick began to chuckle. &ldquo;Pinning
clues onto folks is like the clothing salesman
who tried to sell a white linen suit to a
man who wanted a dark grey one. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give
you what you want,&rsquo; the salesman said&mdash;and he
went over and pulled down all the shades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that-there suit looked dark!&rdquo; chuckled
Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I mean to listen, and watch, and not
suspect anybody, as if I had a dark suit and a
light one to sell and I&rsquo;d wait to see who the
different suits fitted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking into a hearty laugh, Jeff slapped
Sandy on the shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;That-there&rsquo;s the ticket,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Captain Parks turned to his
employer. &ldquo;How about that cruise around New
York to see the buildings lighted up that you
told me to get the yacht ready for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; Mr. Everdail
slapped his thigh. &ldquo;I forgot all about our
birthday dinner and cruise for Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the dinner was being got ready when
you sent for us,&rdquo; remarked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A birthday dinner for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meant for a surprise?&rdquo; chimed in Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving,&rdquo; laughed Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go on board the <i>Tramp</i> and see
what the chef trots out.&rdquo; Mr. Everdail led the
way, inviting the others who had not originally
been planned for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Larsen stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired. Me
for bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; laughed Dick. &ldquo;After a crack-up,
always take a rest-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll shelve this mystery.&rdquo; Mr. Everdail
led the way to the tender which would
transfer them to the yacht for the evening run
around illuminated Manhattan. &ldquo;Eat, and have
a good time, Sky Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, gladly, sir,&rdquo; agreed Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>With the zest of healthy youth the chums
&ldquo;shelved&rdquo; the mystery and hid their chagrin at
being wrong again. The repast provided by the
yacht chef was worth their attention. Especially
palatable was the iced lemonade which the hot,
humid night made very delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they get these ice-cubes the same
tint as the lemonade?&rdquo; Larry wondered, admiring
the yellowish tone of the cubes, as he stirred
the clinking mixture in his tall glass.</p>
<p>Dick grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dye!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;If you want special food
or drink you have to dye-it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To diet!&rdquo; Jeff caught the pun. &ldquo;That-there&rsquo;s
a hot one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It leaves me &lsquo;cold&rsquo;,&rdquo; Larry came back at
him. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m interested about this ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mr. Everdail, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough,&rdquo; the youngest member
of the Sky Patrol broke in. &ldquo;They pour some
of the lemonade into the compartments in the
ice-trays and freeze that. It is better than plain
ice because it doesn&rsquo;t weaken the lemonade at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Larry agreed. &ldquo;Why, Mr.
Everdail, I was only curious. I don&rsquo;t know much
about refrigerating plants and I didn&rsquo;t think
they could turn the ice any color they liked&mdash;but
I see they can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>He dropped the subject, finished his drink
and, with the others, partook of a frozen sherbet
also prepared in the yacht&rsquo;s icing plant.</p>
<p>Finished, they were invited on deck to see the
sights of Manhattan&rsquo;s night sky, with its millions
of electric bulbs, on signs and in high windows,
and on skyscraper domes, painting a fairy
picture against a dark heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you speak about the tinted ice?&rdquo;
Sandy asked, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I explained,&rdquo; Larry retorted. &ldquo;I
hadn&rsquo;t thought about colored ice cubes, ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you taking any hint from the yellow
tones?&rdquo; Sandy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, Sandy. What&rsquo;s in your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;think! If they can freeze lemonade,
and get yellow ice cubes, they can freeze lime
juice&mdash;even something darker&mdash;and get&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green cubes!&rdquo; Larry broke in. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;or
freeze indigo and get blue ones. What of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would dark green ice cubes conceal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both chums stared at Sandy.</p>
<p>What would dark green ice cubes conceal?&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Suddenly Dick gripped his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Emeralds!&rdquo; he almost shouted it, but
dropped his voice instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better place could Captain Parks&mdash;or
anyone else&mdash;find if he thought the life preserver
idea might be too open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the chef would discover it&mdash;they
couldn&rsquo;t be left there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly they could.&rdquo; Sandy was earnest.
&ldquo;If the Captain ordered that they be kept for
his special use&mdash;and if he drank lime juice.
Come on, let&rsquo;s ask him.&rdquo; They followed Sandy
to the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; Sandy asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your favorite
drink? Lemonade or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of lime drinks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, elated and panting, turned to Mr.
Everdail as Dick and Larry raced away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, sir,&rdquo; Sandy panted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
your emeralds!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">THE SKY PATROL GIVES UP</span></h2>
<p>At Sandy&rsquo;s sensational announcement there
was a stampede from the bridge. Soon after
Dick and Larry raced through the cluttered and
deserted dining saloon, it was invaded by the
captain, the millionaire, Miss Serena and others,
with Sandy in the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you discover, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Sandy&rsquo;s cry his chum, as well as the oldest
Sky Patrol, turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>He made a disgusted gesture toward the open
front of the refrigerating box, to the four ice
cube trays lying empty on the galley floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were as empty as our heads!&rdquo; Larry
was dispirited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they were!&rdquo; the chef, who had observed
their invasion of his cookery compartment with
amazement, spoke up. &ldquo;I had to use all of &rsquo;em
to freeze the cubes for your dinner. No use to
fill &rsquo;em again till I wash &rsquo;em up, so I left &rsquo;em out
while I &lsquo;defrost&rsquo; the box&mdash;cut off the current
and let the box get warm enough to melt the
frost that collects when you freeze a lot of
cubes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated the refrigerating unit which had
heavy ice clinging wherever the chill had congealed
the moisture from the evaporation of the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other trays?&rdquo; Mr. Everdail snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only them, sir.&rdquo; The chef threw all the compartments
wide.</p>
<p>Food, ice-drip trays and vegetables in their
dry-air receptacles, were all they discovered by
a painstaking search. A glance into the &ldquo;hydrator&rdquo;
packed with vegetables, crisp lettuce, long
endive, and other varieties, a foray behind and
under everything satisfied them that another
clue had &ldquo;gone West&rdquo;&mdash;and left them very much
out of favor.</p>
<p>No matter how closely they examined the
built-in box, with its glossy enamel and bright,
aluminum trays, nothing except food and drinkables
in bottles revealed themselves.</p>
<p>And that ended it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that was how it would turn out,&rdquo;
Jeff, coming from the after deck, declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgusted with the whole thing,&rdquo; the
yacht owner grumbled. &ldquo;I ought to have known
better than to trust three young men under
seventeen to solve such a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reflected for a moment and then spoke his
final word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall land you at a Brooklyn wharf,
boys, and let you go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what Friday, the thirteenth, does for
you?&rdquo; Jeff said.</p>
<p>Neither of the chums had a word to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The date has nothing to do with it,&rdquo; Mr.
Everdail snapped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their lack of self-control
and experience.&rdquo; He turned and stalked out
of the galley and after him, sorry for the three
members of the disbanded Sky Patrol, Jeff
moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, buddies,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands at
the pier to which the yacht tied up briefly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it stand between your coming out
to that-there new airport once in awhile to see
me. I guess if Atley is through with you he&rsquo;ll
be done with my crate too, so maybe we&rsquo;ll meet
up one of these days soon. If we do, and I have
the money for gas and oil, Larry, you get some
more flying instruction. You may not be a
crackerjack detective, but when it comes to
handling that-there crate, you rate mighty
good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>He said a pleasant word to each of the other
two, added a friendly clap on the arm and, with
Mr. Everdail saying a brief, if not very angry
farewell, the Sky Patrol quit its service, finished
its air work and took to its feet.</p>
<p>Explanations at home accounted for the termination
of their stay, which had been arranged
by telephone at the beginning; and it seemed to
them that the Everdail Emerald mystery was,
as Dick dolefully said, &ldquo;a closed book without
any last pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So despondent was Larry at his failure as a
sleuth that he did not like to discuss their adventures
with his chums.</p>
<p>His depression was more because his air
training was over than from a real sense of
failure. To Larry, one only failed when one
failed to do his best&mdash;and that he had not failed
in.</p>
<p>As a week went by Dick saw something to
laugh about in their wild theories, their almost
fantastic deductions. He found an old stenographers&rsquo;
note book and jotted down, in ludicrous
terms, the many clues and suspicious incidents
they had encountered.</p>
<p>But Sandy was really glum.</p>
<p>To Sandy, the fault for their dismal failure
lay at his own door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t gone off &lsquo;half-cocked&rsquo;,&rdquo; he told
his comrades, &ldquo;maybe we would have seen something
or somebody really worth following up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a vigorous mental resolve never to
be caught in such a trap again.</p>
<p>That very afternoon he passed a news stand
and was chained in his tracks by a small headline
in black type at one corner of a paper, in
a &ldquo;box,&rdquo; or enclosure of ruled lines that set it
off from the other news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look at this!&rdquo; he hailed Larry as
the latter sat on Dick&rsquo;s porch, whittling on the
tiny struts of a model airplane.</p>
<p>Both chums read the box he thrust under
their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ghost Again Walks In Haunted Hangar.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under that heading the story reminded readers
that the Everdail estate had been haunted
several weeks before according to report.</p>
<p>The millionaire, it went on, coming East to
meet his wife, returning on their yacht from
Europe, had investigated the uncanny events reported
to him by his caretaker and others.</p>
<p>He had learned nothing, the reporter had
gleaned from the caretaker of the deserted
estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>However, it ended, as soon as Mr. Everdail
had sailed on the yacht to join his wife at their
lakeside camp in Maine, uncanny light, odd
noises and other strange things had become evident
again, as an excited local correspondent
had notified the paper. Reporters, searching,
and watching, had found nothing so far but the
public would be informed as soon as they discovered
the secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; Larry looked
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; Dick admitted.
&ldquo;No ghost does those things. A real person has
some reason for doing them. Who? And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way we&rsquo;ll find out is by going there,
at night, and watching,&rdquo; Larry declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; Sandy said, surprising his
chums. &ldquo;We were &lsquo;kicked out&rsquo; once. If we
were to be caught on the place we&rsquo;d be trespassers&mdash;and
if the clever news reporters are
watching and don&rsquo;t find anything, how can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be too busy earning money to
finish my flying lessons to bother, anyway,&rdquo;
Larry decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still&mdash;&rdquo; Dick began, and then, looking down
the street, he became alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry! Sandy! Look who&rsquo;s coming. That&rsquo;s
the man who flew in the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; with Mr. Everdail&mdash;the
day the yacht came in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; agreed Larry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming here.
I wonder what for!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;GROUND CREW&rdquo; TAKES HOLD</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, boys. Remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick rose to meet the man, tall, quiet, and
with a smile of greeting on his face that belied
the creases of worry around his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to,&rdquo; Larry also advanced, rather
sheepishly. &ldquo;I tackled you the day you floated
the dory out to the cracked-up seaplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no hard feelings, my friend,&rdquo; the man
shook hands. &ldquo;You wrenched a shoulder that
was already pretty painful&mdash;but you thought
you had a jewel robber to deal with, so let&rsquo;s let
bygones sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands and accepted the lounging
chair Dick offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve introduced myself,&rdquo; the
man began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mr. Whiteside. Of course you
wonder what I am here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally they did. Each nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept pretty well in the background of
this case,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;I am, by profession,
an official of Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s eastern enterprises.
But I consider myself something of an amateur
detective &lsquo;on the side&rsquo; and I want you three to
help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Everdail &lsquo;discharged&rsquo; us.&rdquo; There
was no resentment, only remonstrance, in
Larry&rsquo;s quiet remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it. I have seen him, been up in
Maine. But he has given me a free hand, and
I think you three can be useful. You see, I want
that hangar watched, now that the reporters
have gone away. I can&rsquo;t be there day and night&mdash;I
know,&rdquo; he broke off to explain, &ldquo;that you
three have suspected me of having something
to do with the wrong side of the affair, and
naturally enough. I came upon Larry unawares,
at the seaplane. I accepted his offer about surrendering
jewels and actually had a gun in my
hand at the time. No wonder I fall in line as&mdash;well,
as a suspected person. I don&rsquo;t hold that
against you. As it happens, I am trying to recover
the missing jewels, just because I made
such a failure of rescuing them before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That might, or might not be true, Sandy reflected;
but he maintained a careful guard over
expression and speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t doing anything about the mystery,&rdquo;
stated Sandy, wondering if that might
be the plan&mdash;that this man had come to try to
pump news out of them. If so, Sandy was determined
that as long as they had given up, been
given up, it did not matter if the man knew it
or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will do something! To help me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dick asked, with a mental reservation
as to any promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, go out to the Everdail estate, under
my direction, and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be trespassers,&rdquo; argued Sandy. &ldquo;We
might be arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can arrange all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside turned directly to Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need you for something else,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Atley Everdail isn&rsquo;t here to help, if any situation
developed where I would need a pilot. I
have a theory that makes me think I shall need
one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Tommy Larsen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who had piloted the cracked-up seaplane
was again able to fly, he responded, but
was not safe for a long flight. Besides, the detective
argued, he wanted someone who had
proved himself trustworthy in more things than
flying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had only about nine hours instruction,&rdquo;
Larry said honestly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to risk
soloing on that. I can taxi, handle the &rsquo;plane
to get into the wind, take off and fly level, bank,
turn, circle, spiral, climb, shoot the field and
set down. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all settled in advance,&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside
stated. &ldquo;Tommy Larsen is &lsquo;kicking around&rsquo;
without a job. I&rsquo;ve got his consent to finish your
instruction, and put you in trim for a license by
the end of Summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, watching his friend&rsquo;s face take on an
eager light, a look of longing, decided that Mr.
Whiteside could not have found a more certain
way to fascinate Larry and enlist his cooperation.</p>
<p>Dick, too, showed an interested face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be great!&rdquo; Larry declared. Then
he became more serious, adding. &ldquo;Finishing up
my course would be fine, but if it means that I&rsquo;d
have to do anything against Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s
wishes, after he told us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wishes to recover those emeralds, my
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has agreed with Miss Serena that
they are destroyed,&rdquo; Dick objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think they are not destroyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave them his theory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;When Everdail gave me all the facts he had
about the London attempt to ruin the emeralds,
the first idea I had was that some independent
robber had failed to find the real gems
and, in spite, had damaged the imitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no other jewels were taken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That supported his decision that neither a
single robber nor a band of miscreants had
planned the affair. They would have taken all
the real stones, and he believed that these were
numerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I weighed the situation,&rdquo; went on the detective.
&ldquo;A robber would be enough of a gem expert
to know the stones were imitations and
would have taken the others. But&mdash;some Hindu
fanatic, in India, where the emeralds came from
originally, might have a fixed idea that they
must be destroyed. He might not know imitations
from real ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would explain why acid was put on
them,&rdquo; agreed Dick. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t explain any
other attempts, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I argued that as soon as a Hindu accomplished
the entry to the hotel and believed
he had destroyed the stones, he would stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you and Mr. Everdail fly out
to meet the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to take every precaution, Larry.
There was a chance that no Hindu was involved.
It might be someone with what the French call
an <i>idee fixee</i>&mdash;a fixed notion&mdash;a demented purpose
of destroying emeralds&mdash;no other stones
were treated with acid except those lying in the
little pool around the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there people as crazy as that? And
going around, loose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once in awhile you hear of such people,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t anybody in England give up
then?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody who remained in England would
have to&mdash;he&rsquo;d be left there. But&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside
leaned forward and spoke meaningly, &ldquo;&mdash;a
man sailed from England&mdash;and although I did
not know it at the time, I have checked up, since,
and the man from London is an English circus
acrobat&mdash;who went in for &lsquo;stunting&rsquo; on airplanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who claimed to be a secret agent of
a London insurance firm?&rdquo; asked Dick, amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The firm sent no investigator!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have found the man who is guilty!&rdquo;
exclaimed Dick. &ldquo;He was with Tommy Larsen,
hired him to go out to meet the yacht!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be the fact,&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside
admitted. &ldquo;Before the arrival of the yacht I
had no inkling that this fellow had come over;
but Mrs. Everdail was so nervous and worried,
we decided to fly out to meet the yacht, just as
Jeff, who had been retained before Everdail
found me, decided to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Sandy had made no contribution to the discussion.</p>
<p>He spoke, at last, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, early in the adventure, that nothing
was what it seemed to be,&rdquo; Sandy remarked.
&ldquo;This backs me up. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this, Mr. Whiteside&mdash;we are sure
he made a try for the emeralds in the seaplane
he hired. He thought they were destroyed&mdash;at
least he had done all he could to destroy them.
Then&mdash;why did he make another try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d done what he intended,&rdquo;
argued Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had ruined them! Wasn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea is that he learned&mdash;there was an
accomplice on the yacht&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mimi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps! He must have learned that the real
gems were not ruined at all,&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think his confederate threw the real
ones overboard, in the life preserver, with the
ruined imitations tied to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to answer Larry, the detective hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t check up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The confederate&mdash;Mimi&mdash;knew
the imitations! She
wouldn&rsquo;t throw them at all. If she knew the
real ones were hidden in that life belt she&rsquo;d
have flung that. But we know that the imitations
went overside and were in the gum&mdash;as
Sandy cleverly discovered. So&mdash;that makes it
all muddled up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how the haunted hangar
comes in,&rdquo; protested Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to discover. It does come
in&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of that! You, and Dick and Sandy,
can help, I believe. Two to watch the hangar,
taking turns, and with my aid whenever I can
manage it. You, Larry, to perfect your flying
technique and be ready if I need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds good to me!&rdquo; urged Larry, turning
to his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I say, let&rsquo;s reorganize,&rdquo; Dick had a
twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;You, Larry, will be the sole
member of the Sky Patrol&mdash;and Sandy and I
will be&mdash;er&mdash;the &lsquo;ground crew&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good description,&rdquo; the detective
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Sandy. &ldquo;Dick, you and I
are the ground crew. As soon as you&rsquo;re ready,
Mr. Whiteside, we&rsquo;ll take hold!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">LARRY &ldquo;SOLOS&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Taking hold, for the &ldquo;ground crew,&rdquo; required
some argument with parents. Mr. Whiteside
seemed to have some magical way of overcoming
objections to possible night activity, however;
and the next morning found the two reinstated
assistants riding with Mr. Whiteside
on a &rsquo;bus bound for the town nearest to the
old Everdail estate.</p>
<p>Their morning work consisted of investigating
the hangar, outside and inside.</p>
<p>The caretaker raised no objections. He seemed
entirely satisfied that Mr. Whiteside was exactly
what he claimed to be, and so Dick, who
had held some misgivings, accepted the man as a
detective and worked with a will to discover
some clue to the means used by the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; for
getting in and out of the hangar.</p>
<p>In that the trio failed, and had to give up
until night would let them return and establish
a keen guard over the haunted structure.</p>
<p>Larry fared much better.</p>
<p>He found Tommy Larsen much improved in
health, with his nerves again steady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel uneasy about short hops,&rdquo; the
pilot informed him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d want
to take a long control job just yet, though. Now
let&rsquo;s see what Jeff put into you. Before I go
up with you, tell me what you&rsquo;d do if you were
really starting off alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Larry said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go over to
the weather display board, to see what the flying
conditions would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did learn!&rdquo; Tommy was pleased. &ldquo;Yep!
That&rsquo;s important. Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d notice the windsock, while I&rsquo;d go to my
crate. If it wasn&rsquo;t already running, I&rsquo;d start
the engine&mdash;being sure to repeat every syllable
of the &lsquo;mech&rsquo;s&rsquo; words when he turned the prop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want any mistake on your
part to have the juice on when he swung that
prop to suck in the charge&mdash;good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if the airplane was on a cement
apron in front of the hangar, it would be all
right to start the engine there. But in sandy
ground, or on a dusty apron, I&rsquo;d be sure the
tail wasn&rsquo;t pointed so the propeller blast would
throw dust on &rsquo;planes or on people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilot Tommy Larsen nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t intend to be a dusting pilot, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Then I&rsquo;d warm up the engine&mdash;by
granny-golly-gracious! I forgot something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, unless I&rsquo;d seen him do it, before even
the engine was started, I&rsquo;d want to be sure the
&lsquo;rigger&rsquo; of my crew would go over the crate and
wipe it with a soft rag, so any frayed wires
would be noticed&mdash;and I&rsquo;d want to be sure he
had inspected the &rsquo;plane either when it landed
last or before I&rsquo;d take off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff was a good teacher, I see. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry went through the explanation of his
method of taxiing, with the elevators up enough
to keep the tail on the ground as he used the
throttle to regulate speed, and the ailerons to
govern the wings and keep them from being
tipped up or down by wind or uneven ground,
as well as his idea of using the rudder to hold
the ship on its straight travel to the point of
take-off and how he would turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! If you know all that about getting
set, you might as well let me see you do it!&rdquo;
Thus Larry began his tenth hour of instruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>That completed, and with a quiet compliment
for the way he had made his final check of the
engine and instruments while the chocks were
still under the wheels, with a word of advice
about not trying to lift the ship off the ground
in a cross-wind until a safe margin of speed
was assured, Larsen bade him return that afternoon.
Larry, pleased, went to his lunch, turning
over in his mind the many things he
had done, to see if he had done any of them
in the wrong way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I corrected the tendency of the wind to turn
the crate as we taxied, and I lifted her off and
leveled for a couple of seconds so that the prop
could bring back flying speed before climbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had also chosen a moderate climbing
angle, keeping a watch for any incoming craft
as he went higher before banking and turning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remembered to return the controls to
neutral when I had the ship flying just the way
I wanted it to,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t over-control.
Maybe&mdash;maybe it won&rsquo;t be long before
Tommy will let me solo.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>At three that afternoon Larsen informed him
that he was to take up the dual-control craft
they had hired from a flying friend of the pilot&rsquo;s
at Roosevelt Field the second, on Long Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;thank you. I&rsquo;ll keep cool&mdash;and do
my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked to the airplane, standing before
its hangar, determined to use the after seat, as
did most pilots flying alone in a dual machine,
and turned to Tommy inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the sack of sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. If I am in the front and you are
in the other place, and the airplane balances
and flies easily, there must be something to
make up the difference when you aren&rsquo;t along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the sack had provided stability in
the front place, Larry, feeling a little anxious,
but more about making mistakes under the
pilot&rsquo;s watchful eye in starting than about his
performance in the air, got the engine
started, warmed up, checked, put the craft into
the wind, signaled for chocks to be pulled away,
gave a spurt of the &ldquo;gun&rdquo; to start it, accelerated
speed till the ship began to want to take the
air itself, having remembered to use the elevators
to lift the tail skid free from dragging&mdash;and
with a return of elevators to normal right
away to keep the craft level on its run&mdash;he drew
back on the stick, widened the throttle feed a
trifle, returned the elevators to normal as he attained
the safe climbing angle, and was up and
away on his first solo flight.</p>
<p>In his whole life he had never felt such a sense
of elation!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The whole fifteen minutes that he stayed up
were like moments of freedom&mdash;alone, master
of his craft, able to control it as he would&mdash;there
is not, in the whole world, another sensation
to equal that of the first solo flight of a
youthful pilot who combines confidence in himself
with knowledge of his &rsquo;plane and how it
responds.</p>
<p>The heavens were his!</p>
<p>No bird ever was more free.</p>
<p>And when he made his landing, perfectly setting
down on wheels and tail-skid as Jeff had
taught him, &ldquo;I wish all my pupils were like
him,&rdquo; said a flying instructor who had been
watching. Larry, doffing his tight &ldquo;crash&rdquo; helmet,
overheard.</p>
<p>It was the most cherished compliment he
could wish.</p>
<p>And that marked the beginning of ten days
of flying, sometimes with Tommy to give him
the evolutions of recovering from side-slips,
skids, tail spins, and other possibilities of flying,
none of them hazards at sensible altitude, and
with a calm mind guiding the controls. At other
times &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; were taught, not to make him a
daredevil, but because, in flying, an airplane
sometimes gets into positions where the pilot
must know every possible means of extricating
it. Solo, and with Tommy, Larry became a good
pilot.</p>
<p>And in all that time, his &ldquo;ground crew&rdquo;&mdash;got
nowhere!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">A PUZZLING DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Dick slapped Sandy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;The &lsquo;man higher up&rsquo; has come down to earth!
Here comes Larry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sight for sore eyes!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed
as the youthful amateur pilot joined his
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen much of you, I know.&rdquo; Larry
sat down on the swing by Dick on the latter&rsquo;s
veranda. &ldquo;Daytimes I&rsquo;ve been studying rigging
and checking up on an airplane, because Tommy
thinks a pilot ought to know everything there
is to know about his ship because he may have
to do things himself if he gets hold of a careless
rigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the pilot didn&rsquo;t know the right way he
couldn&rsquo;t say if his helper was doing things the
wrong way,&rdquo; agreed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that hasn&rsquo;t kept you away evenings,&rdquo;
objected Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy has been very good to me, giving
me his time, in his room, so he could tell me all
the &lsquo;fine points&rsquo; he has picked up about flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sky Patrol&rsquo;s report received, considered and
accepted,&rdquo; Dick stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for yours,&rdquo; Larry smiled. &ldquo;What has
the Ground Crew done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watched, evenings, turn and turn about, till
midnight,&rdquo; Dick told him. &ldquo;Mr. Whiteside took
the day shift and came on to relieve us every
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What progress have you made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, responding to Larry, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything to happen
if you&rsquo;d seen all the reporters who have
been &lsquo;hanging around&rsquo; the old estate. Why, one
has slept in that hangar a couple of nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ghost with any self-respect would make a
show of himself for newspaper publicity!&rdquo; Dick
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost all we needed to do was to watch
the reporters,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;But they have
given up, I guess. There was only one out
last night, and he told me he thought the paper
that ran that &lsquo;box&rsquo; had played a trick on the
others and on the readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Larry remarked. &ldquo;Now the
coast will be clear, the ghost can walk, and I
will be with my trusty comrades to trip him up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems queer to me,&rdquo; Dick spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
thought a lot about it. The fellow who played
ghost must be searching for something. What
can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emeralds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was there before they were lost,
Dick,&rdquo; Larry objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something that just came to me.&rdquo;
Sandy bent forward in the lounging chair.
&ldquo;Nothing has happened at night, for ten days.
But all that time, Mr. Whiteside has been on
the &lsquo;day watch,&rsquo; as he calls it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-gracious!&rdquo; Larry exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you
think?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jeff flew us there, the first time, there
seemed to be somebody in that hangar when we
started in,&rdquo; Dick added to Sandy&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Sandy admitted. &ldquo;By the
way, Jeff is back at Bennett Field, taking up
passengers for hire again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying about Jeff.&rdquo; Larry was
caught by the suspicious action of their &ldquo;detective&rdquo;
in taking the day watch while nothing occurred
at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of going out there to the
hangar now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>They thought very well of the idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>It was close to noon when the &rsquo;bus deposited
them at the town from which they had to walk
to the estate.</p>
<p>Strolling down the quiet street toward the
main highway, Sandy&rsquo;s alert eyes, always roving,
caught sight of the estate caretaker. They
hailed him and ran to the corner where he had
turned to wave to them.</p>
<p>He greeted them sourly. Plainly the caretaker
was out of sorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;More dern amachoor
detectives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s grin of
salutation changed to a look of hurt surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I say it? Ain&rsquo;t it enough I
had reporters an&rsquo; all rampagin&rsquo; through the
place without you three got to come, on top o&rsquo;
that Whiteside feller and Jeff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Whiteside&mdash;and Jeff?&rdquo; repeated Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep! Nights it&rsquo;s been bad enough&mdash;now it&rsquo;s
daytimes! Ghosts! Reporters! Snoopers! And
now you fellers in the daytime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Mr. Whiteside&mdash;and Jeff?&rdquo; Dick
wanted to get to the bottom of a startling situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know&mdash;that Whiteside
feller was there, as per usual, and along come
Jeff, limpin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Limping? Was he hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had his foot tied up, Master Larry. Said he
was flyin&rsquo; and his power quit and he had to
come down in a bad spot and a lot more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once started on his troubles and their cause,
the caretaker needed no more prompting. Jeff,
he went on, had met Mr. Whiteside and said that
if he wanted to fly he&rsquo;d have to go in that other
thing that they put in the water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hydroplane boat?&rdquo; Sandy broke in to
ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the ampibbian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amphibian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded as they walked down toward
the highway. After he helped the others to get
the water-and-land &rsquo;plane onto the field, he
grumbled, and had turned the propeller blades
till his arms ached, the superstitious pilot, saying
he had stumbled and fallen that morning
and knew something would go wrong, had decided
that they had no time to repair or find
the trouble in the amphibian.</p>
<p>They must get going, he reported that Mr.
Whiteside had declared, and Jeff had argued
that if he had a six-B slotted bolt, he could fix
his motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never did hear of a six-B slotted bolt&mdash;or
any slotted bolt,&rdquo; declared Dick, while Sandy
and Larry assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did the hardware man here in town
after that Whiteside feller gave me five dollars
to walk in the four miles and&mdash;back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick consulted his comrades with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds to me like sending a new machine
shop hand to the foreman for a left-handed
monkey wrench,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
played a joke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t fit in,&rdquo; argued Larry. &ldquo;A bandaged
foot, a limping pilot, an engine that
wouldn&rsquo;t start&mdash;and sending this gentleman on
an errand that would take him away for a good
while&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did Jeff say he set down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caretaker turned and scowled at Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never set down nowhere. He leaned
against the hangar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;where is his own airplane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three comrades wished heartily that Jeff
had revealed the information. Since he had not,
each cudgeled his brains for some likely place
within walking distance of the estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;six-B slotted bolt&rsquo; makes me think his
engine hasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with it at all,&rdquo;
Larry stated, finally. &ldquo;Furthermore, I think
he put down his crate in some handy&mdash;good&mdash;spot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;A crackerjack pilot like Jeff could get in on
a pretty small field,&rdquo; Larry argued. &ldquo;One place
I can think of that isn&rsquo;t a bad landing spot is
the fairway of the ninth hole on that golf course
yonder.&rdquo; He indicated the grounds of a golf
club. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s away from everything, and he might
fly over the course, see that no foursome or twosome
was likely to get there for some time&mdash;&rdquo;
Dick nodded, agreeing; but Sandy shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bothers me,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;is that if his
engine is all right, Mr. Whiteside would have
met him and gone in Jeff&rsquo;s ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless&mdash;unless they wanted to make a water
landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly-gracious, Dick! I think you&rsquo;ve found
the reason&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Larry&mdash;why wouldn&rsquo;t they use the
hydroplane boat?&rdquo; Sandy was not convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the amphibian would be quicker&mdash;and
maybe they don&rsquo;t want to land but need
the pontoons in case of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, laying a hand on Larry&rsquo;s arm, stopped
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have guessed the answer,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They
wanted to get rid of this gentleman,&rdquo; he nodded
toward the caretaker. &ldquo;Then they could search
that hangar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they, themselves, had done that thoroughly!
Larry made the objection but Dick
waved a hand to dismiss it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost hadn&rsquo;t found anything. We
hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve decided
there is something&mdash;and if it isn&rsquo;t there when
they make a good search, they think they know
where else to look&mdash;and it&rsquo;s either in the water&mdash;or
over the water&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the swamp where the seaplane crashed!&rdquo;
shouted Sandy, complimenting Dick with a
sound smack on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s look on that fairway and see if
the airplane is there, and if the engine runs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The airplane was there. The engine operated
readily.</p>
<p>While they discussed these proofs of Dick&rsquo;s
quick wit, the sound of an airplane engine
turned all eyes skyward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;phib&rsquo;!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;get in!&rdquo; Larry urged. &ldquo;I can fly
this crate&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll see what they&rsquo;re going to
do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">HIGH WINGS!</span></h2>
<p>If he never did so again, Sandy lived up to
his decision to turn over a new leaf for once.</p>
<p>Usually impulsive, generally quick to adopt
any new suspicion, he surprised his chums by
catching Larry by the coat and dragging him
back to the ground as his foot rested on the
wing-step bracing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No! Larry&mdash;Dick&mdash;you,
Mister! Come on, quick&mdash;under these trees
yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Jeff will
fly over his crate to see if it&rsquo;s all right. He
may see us. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So sound was his argument that the others
hurried with him to the concealment of the
nearby grove, after Larry had thoughtfully cut
out the ignition so that the propeller would not
revolve if its observers flew low enough to distinguish
its position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Well hidden, they learned how wise Sandy
had been.</p>
<p>Coming closer as it dropped lower, the amphibian
circled in a tight swing over the fairway
several times and finally straightened out, flying
toward the wind that came from almost due
North on this first cool day after a humid July
week, and began to grow smaller to the
watchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get that engine started, now.&rdquo;
Dick left the grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be careful,&rdquo; commented Sandy. &ldquo;They
may come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can be warming it up and watching!&rdquo;
Larry urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to hurry,&rdquo; Sandy insisted. &ldquo;I
think I know&mdash;at last!&mdash;what this all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three voices, that of the caretaker no longer
grumpy, urged him to explain. Too earnest to
be proud of his deductions, Sandy spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the hangar was first haunted, and we
found chewing gum that the ghost had put there,
as we thought,&rdquo; he told an interested trio, &ldquo;none
of us could work out any answer to the puzzle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;But stop and think of these things,&rdquo; he continued,
urging his two friends to use their own
imaginations. &ldquo;The amphibian was old-looking
and didn&rsquo;t seem to be much good, and the gas
gauge was broken, and the chewing gum was
quite fresh. That might look as though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some pilot was getting the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; ready to
fly and chewed gum as he worked and put the
gauge out of order to keep anybody from knowing
he had filled the gas tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good guess, Larry! It&rsquo;s the way I work it
out,&rdquo; Dick added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, young feller.&rdquo; The caretaker was
absorbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Sandy grinned, &ldquo;the chewing gum disappeared!
Supposing the fellow we thought we
saw vanishing really was there and got out
some way. He&rsquo;d know, from Jeff landing us
and our going in, that the amphibian might not
be usable when he&rsquo;d need it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he went back and got the gum&mdash;but
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was getting that ready, Dick, for the
emeralds&mdash;remember how Sandy discovered the
place the imitations were hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Larry. Go on, Sandy. You&rsquo;ve
got a brilliant brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Sandy protested. &ldquo;It just flashed
over me&mdash;putting all the facts together, the way
I made up my mind I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He outlined the rest of his inference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was proved&mdash;the seaplane coming out
to the yacht proved that the passenger who said
he was a London agent, and wasn&rsquo;t at all, had
changed his plans. Well, say that he had arranged
with Mimi, Mrs. Everdail&rsquo;s maid, to
have her throw over the jewels&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she wouldn&rsquo;t make the mistake of giving
a confederate the wrong ones. She&rsquo;d seen the
real ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were working on the check-up and
warming of the engine as they talked. Dick
made the objection to Sandy&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d know that the man knew the difference
too!&rdquo; Larry added.</p>
<p>That could be true, Sandy admitted. But he
argued that the girl must have seen the captain
take the stern life preserver to his cabin,
and might have guessed, even observed through
a cabin port, what he did. In that case she would
have thrown over the life preserver knowing
that her confederate would put it in the seaplane.
And he had done exactly that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the passenger jumped with a different
life preserver!&rdquo; Dick was more anxious to prove
every step of Sandy&rsquo;s argument than to find
flaws in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we found the life preserver that they
might have had on board the seaplane all the
time. And the other one&mdash;we never thought of
the yacht&rsquo;s name being painted on its own
things. So we took it for granted that we had
the real hiding place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You argue real good, young feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. Well, if that was true&mdash;and
if it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;why is the ghost walking again in
the very hangar that the seaplane wreckage is
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a clinching statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. And the passenger, who has
been out of sight, has been haunting the hangar,
trying to find the other life belt,&rdquo; Larry took up
the theory. &ldquo;Mr. Whiteside must have guessed
that, too, and he planned today to make a good
search and if he didn&rsquo;t find what he wanted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d fly over that swamp and see if the
other belt had fallen out of the seaplane&mdash;and
he&rsquo;d need a pilot&mdash;so he got Jeff!&rdquo; Dick put the
finishing touch to the revelation. &ldquo;Larry kept
Tommy busy, so Mr. Whiteside got Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we ought to be flying&mdash;the engine
wasn&rsquo;t very cold&mdash;it&rsquo;s safe to hop.&rdquo; Larry took
a step toward the airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still claim we needn&rsquo;t hurry,&rdquo; Sandy
argued. &ldquo;If we go too soon, they will be sure to
see us and give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may find the life preserver if it&rsquo;s
still there and get away with the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s still there, Larry, it will take some
hunting. Anyway, we almost know their plans.
If they don&rsquo;t find anything they will come back
to the hangar with the crate. If they do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may go anywhere,&rdquo; Dick declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say not to follow them. But
I do say let&rsquo;s take our time. Isn&rsquo;t there some
way we can work out so they won&rsquo;t be likely to
discover us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry stared. Then he nodded and grew very
thoughtful.</p>
<p>At last he delivered a suggestion that met
unanimous approval.</p>
<p>The airplane, with a more powerful engine
and better flying qualities, could go higher than
the amphibian which was both slower and more
clumsy. To that argument he added the information
that if the binoculars they had first used
were still where Dick had put them, in the airplane
pocket, they could find the ship&rsquo;s &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo;&mdash;the
highest point to which power would
take it and the air could still sustain it at flying
speed&mdash;and from that height, in one look
downward discover the truth or falsity of their
theory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; is flying low over the marsh,
we can go off as far as we can and still see it,&rdquo;
he finished. &ldquo;Then if they fly back to the hangar,
we can outfly them on a different side of the
island and get here in time to leave Jeff&rsquo;s crate
while we go and see what they do. They won&rsquo;t
suspect that we&rsquo;re near, and if the caretaker
goes with us as a witness to check up our story
and to help balance the fourth seat, we can
either come back if they do or follow them if
they go somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within half an hour, high in air, the airplane
found its quarry!</p>
<p>With a cry of delight, unheard in the engine
drone, Dick took the powerful glasses from his
eyes, passed them to Sandy and then rubbed
his hands vigorously to rid them of the chill
of the high altitude.</p>
<p>Sandy had only to take one look when he located
the object of their flight, to know that his
deductions had all been sound.</p>
<p>Close to the grassy, channel-divided marsh,
flying in a sort of spiral to cover every bit of
ground, the amphibian was moving.</p>
<p>Sandy generously recollected the caretaker
and sent back the glass.</p>
<p>Larry, informed by Sandy&rsquo;s gesture of the
discovery, nodded, took a second to jam his
cap tighter, glad that it fitted so close that it
could partly save his hair from the blasting,
pulling wind&mdash;he had no helmet!&mdash;banked and
leveled off into a course that would take them
straight away from the locality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to catch us cruising,&rdquo; he
murmured to himself.</p>
<p>After a short flight he came around in a wide
swing, so that the airplane was over the Sound
and then crossed the marsh again from that
direction.</p>
<p>The report he got was that the amphibian was
still flying.</p>
<p>But the next approach told a new development.</p>
<p>The &rsquo;plane beneath them had set down!</p>
<p>That caused Larry to determine to circle over
the place. They had found something, perhaps,
down below!</p>
<p>When Sandy waved in an excited gesture,
twenty minutes later, and Larry&rsquo;s keen eyes saw
the amphibian, a tiny dot, moving over the
Sound, he felt sure that the missing life preserver
had been found.</p>
<p>Taking a quick glance at gas gauge, altimeter,
tachometer and his other instruments, he
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow
them and see what they do and where they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On high wings the pursuit began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE RACE</span></h2>
<p>Judged by the theory they had worked out,
the action of the men in the amphibian indicated
that they were flying away with something they
had found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they had given up, so soon,&rdquo; Dick mused,
holding his head low to avoid the icy blast of
their high position, &ldquo;if they&rsquo;d given up Jeff
would go straight to the hangar again. But
they&rsquo;re going across Long Island Sound toward
Connecticut, just as the unknown person in the
hydroplane boat did with the other life preserver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry, holding speed at a safe flying margin
so that the sustentation, or lifting power of the
air, was greater than the drag of the airplane
as it resisted the airflow, let the nose drop a
trifle, let the engine rev down as he glided to
a lower level where the air would not bite so
much. They would be able to follow quite as
well, dropping behind just enough to keep the
line of distance between them as great as if they
were higher and closer over the amphibian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>With his glasses, Dick could observe and indicate
any change of direction or any other
maneuver.</p>
<p>They had devised a hastily planned code of
signals, very much like those used by a flying
school instructor giving orders to a pupil where
the Gossport helmet was not worn.</p>
<p>Dick, watchful and alert, lowered his chilled
glasses and Sandy, keeping watch, saw his right
arm extend straight out from his shoulder,
laterally to the airplane&rsquo;s course.</p>
<p>Sandy repeated the gesture after attracting
Larry&rsquo;s attention by a slight shaking of the
dual-control rudder which was still attached,
but which, on any other occasion, he had been
careful not to touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left arm extended! Turn that way!&rdquo; Larry
murmured.</p>
<p>Gently he moved the stick to lower the left
aileron, bringing up the right one, of course, by
their mutual operation; rudder went left a trifle
and in a safe, forty-five degree bank, he began
to turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Almost instantly Dick again removed the
chilly glasses, stuck his arm out ahead of him
with his forearm and hand elevated, and motioned
forward with the wrist and hand.</p>
<p>The signal was relayed by Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resume straight flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry, getting the message correctly, reversed
control, brought the airplane back to
straight, level position on the new angle, and
held it steady, revving up his engine and lifting
the nose in a climb as Sandy gave him
Dick&rsquo;s sign, hand pointed straight upward, to
climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are they going to do?&rdquo; he
wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they discovered us?&rdquo; Dick pondered
the possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess this one,&rdquo; Sandy muttered.
&ldquo;They started to turn one way, then went on
only a little off the old course, and now they&rsquo;re
coming up toward where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem was not answered, either by the
continued gain in elevation or by the later
change of plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gliding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, as he made the exclamation, gestured
with his arm toward the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>To Sandy&rsquo;s signal Larry cut the gun, keeping
the throttle open just enough to be sure
the engine, in that chill air, would not stall, and
with stick sent forward and then returned to
neutral, imitated the gentle glide of the amphibian.</p>
<p>What it meant none of the three knew any
better than did the half frozen caretaker who
wished very sincerely that he had never come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy! Sandy!&rdquo; Dick cried as loudly as he
could. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done a sharp turn&mdash;they&rsquo;re
going back home I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry did not need to have the intricate signal
relayed, nor did he wait to be told his passengers&rsquo;
deduction. Their own maneuvers had
given him a clue.</p>
<p>With the first change of direction and the
following indecision that showed in the amphibian&rsquo;s
shifts of direction, Larry spelled a
change of plan on the part of its occupants. The
resulting glide, enabling his chums to speak
above the idling noise of the engine, indicated a
similar possibility in the other ship&mdash;Jeff and
Mr. Whiteside were talking over plans.</p>
<p>He rightly decided that they had recalled
sending the caretaker on a foolish errand. They
must get back and make some explanation or he
would suspect them, perhaps report to somebody
else. They could not know that he was
shivering, crouched down in the last place of
Jeff&rsquo;s own airplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Now for a race, Larry muttered, almost automatically
moving the throttle wider as he prepared
to alter their course.</p>
<p>It came to him, swiftly, that this would be
both a race and a complication.</p>
<p>Not only must they get the airplane back to
the golf course and set it down and have its
engine still, themselves being hidden before Jeff
flew over it. Furthermore, they must get to the
hangar and be somewhere near the field when
Jeff brought home the amphibian&mdash;or they
would never know whether he and his companion
had found anything or not.</p>
<p>Larry had to do a little rapid mental arithmetic.</p>
<p>To avoid being sighted and identified when
passing the amphibian, the airplane must cut
inland instead of making a beeline for the golf
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would make the return to their objective
form a rough letter &ldquo;L&rdquo; in the air.</p>
<p>However, at the far end of its flight the
amphibian must turn inland a similar distance
to fly over the golf fairway. That made the
flying problem one of speed and not of distance
traveled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The airplane, selected for its wing-camber
and span that gave it a low landing speed and
good sustentation, was not fast.</p>
<p>The amphibian was even more slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distance to cover, seventy miles,&rdquo; Larry
pondered. &ldquo;Our best speed, Jeff said, once, was
about seventy miles an hour. The &lsquo;phib&rsquo; does
sixty, top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made his calculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No leeway to get to the hangar&mdash;Sandy
might, barely, because he was on the track team,
last school term. That is our only chance. But,
at that, it will be &lsquo;nip-and-tuck&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No air race can give the thrill of other forms
of speed competition as does the horse race, the
motor boat or sailing race, the track meet or
the automobile speedway contests.</p>
<p>The distance is too great to permit spectators
to observe it, the ships scatter, seek different
elevations, or in other ways fail to keep that
close formation which makes of the hundred-yard
dash such a blood-stimulating incident.</p>
<p>The automobile contest generally follows a
course where watchers have vantage points for
gathering.</p>
<p>The sailboats or motor craft can be accompanied
or seen through marine glasses.</p>
<p>To air pilots, of course, there is plenty of excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>It is their skill, their ability to take advantage
of every bit of tailwind, their power to
get the utmost of safe &ldquo;go&rdquo; out of engine, wings
and tail assembly, that keeps them alert and decides
the outcome.</p>
<p>So it was in Larry&rsquo;s race, with Dick, Sandy
and the caretaker.</p>
<p>It could not be watched or followed; but to
the occupants of the ship it was a thrilling competition
with the mystery element adding zest;
and when, with a fair tailwind aiding him,
Larry shot the improvised &ldquo;field&rdquo; of the ninth
fairway, making sure at cost of one complete
circuit that no one was there, playing, the thrill
for them was not over.</p>
<p>Sandy caught Larry&rsquo;s idea even before the
airplane had taxied to its place, close to the
original take-off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo; cried Sandy, coat flung aside, collar
ripped away, as he leaped fleetly along the
soft turf. Not waiting to observe his progress,
Dick and Larry busied themselves getting the
airplane tail around into the same position it
had originally occupied.</p>
<p>The engine had long before been stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>From the air, to an observer who had no idea
that his craft had been used, all should seem
natural, Larry decided as he and Dick, with
Sandy&rsquo;s discarded garments, and with the caretaker
ruefully grumbling, chose a place of concealment.</p>
<p>Already the drone of the amphibian came
from the shore side of the field, and in a low,
quick swing, followed by a zooming departure,
Jeff and Mr. Whiteside passed overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Larry remarked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;And it will be a close
thing for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does!&rdquo; grunted the caretaker.</p>
<p>For the answer they had to wait till dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">SANDY&rsquo;S DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Although he was the central figure in an unusual
situation, Sandy was more puzzled than
enlightened by its surprising development.</p>
<p>A footrace against a flying ship was novel
enough; but the maneuver of the amphibian was
still more strange. It was baffling to Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy gave up the race very quickly.</p>
<p>Hearing the approach of an aircraft he sought
concealment under roadside trees, continuing
his steady trot. His heart sank as he identified
the amphibian making its swinging oval from
water to land and around the fairway and back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; Sandy slowed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew that it was safe for him to leave his
shelter. The &ldquo;phib&rdquo; was past him in its zooming
return from the golf course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll never know what they found, or
if they found anything in the swamp,&rdquo; he told
himself dejectedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Then his attention was fixed and his mind became
mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their crate, all righty,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;But&mdash;they&rsquo;re not landing on the estate. I
suppose they&rsquo;ve come to see that Jeff&rsquo;s &rsquo;plane
was safe. Now they&rsquo;ll go on to Connecticut and
we are defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came out onto the road, walking with bent
head as soon as he had caught his breath again.</p>
<p>For a moody few minutes he considered the
wisdom of rejoining his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;When I don&rsquo;t join them
they&rsquo;ll come over to the estate. It might be a
good idea to go on to the landing field and see
if the amphibian dropped off anything with a
small parachute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pursued his way without haste. While
he had been divesting himself of his coat Larry
had urged the caretaker to go on to his duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on!&rdquo; Sandy murmured more cheerfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a clear half hour to myself.
Maybe&mdash;without anybody talking and disturbing
me&mdash;I might think out some answer to all
the queer things that have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>The failure of the amphibian to return to its
home field he disposed of by deciding that its
pilot meant to take something to some rendezvous
in Connecticut, the one, no doubt, the
hydroplane boat had made for.</p>
<p>The thing that came into his mind and stuck
there, offering neither explanations nor a solution
was the mystery of how that man had disappeared
out of the hangar on their first visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find out how the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; gets in
and out again,&rdquo; he reflected.</p>
<p>Deep in the problem he looked up at a sound.</p>
<p>To his surprise, astonishing him so much that
he stopped in the middle of a stride, the lodgekeeper&rsquo;s
gate of an estate he was passing
opened suddenly and Sandy found himself staring
at the last person in the world he expected
to meet.</p>
<p>Facing him with a grin was Jeff!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, buddy,&rdquo; the pilot said, without any
show of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;uh&mdash;hello, Jeff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your way to solve that-there spook business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Sandy made up his mind to see if he
could startle Jeff into a change of expression
and changed his stammering indecision into a
cool retort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;met the estate caretaker in the village.
He asked me to run on ahead and tell you&mdash;and
Mr. Whiteside&mdash;&rdquo; Sandy watched, &ldquo;&mdash;he
could not find a Six-B slotted bolt anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, couldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff did not change a muscle of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry he had all the trouble. We got the
&lsquo;phib&rsquo; engine going and I took Whiteside off on
a little private matter in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you brought him back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Set down in the little inlet, yonder.&rdquo; He
waved toward the shoreline concealed beyond
the estate shrubbery. &ldquo;It was closer to my own
crate&mdash;it&rsquo;s stalled yonder in the golf course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;stalled! Sandy repressed a taunt and
pretended to accept the false statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear Larry&rsquo;s been getting instruction off
that-there Tom Larsen,&rdquo; Jeff turned suddenly
on Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Whiteside paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would do no harm, Sandy thought, to let
Jeff know that his fellow conspirator, if that
was Mr. Whiteside&rsquo;s real standing, was not
playing fair. &ldquo;When people who may be wicked
turn against each other, we learn a lot,&rdquo; Sandy
decided.</p>
<p>He failed in his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy&rsquo;s a good pilot,&rdquo; Jeff admitted. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
be on my way. See you at the next air
Derby!&rdquo; Jeff grinned at his joke and walked on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>So did Sandy.</p>
<p>While he hurried on, pausing only to collect
a &ldquo;wienie&rdquo; and roll for lunch, Larry and Dick
saw Jeff approach across the green of the fairway
and took cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s inspecting that airplane&mdash;I hope we
didn&rsquo;t leave any clues!&rdquo; whispered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s feeling the engine cowling&mdash;he wonders
how the motor stayed so warm,&rdquo; Larry retorted
under his breath. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s looking
around&mdash;get down low, Dick&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s shaking
his head. Now he&rsquo;s in the cockpit. There! He
caught the spark on a compression stroke&mdash;used
his &lsquo;booster magneto.&rsquo; There goes the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, from the descent of Jeff, to give the
ground careful inspection to the moment when
he gave up his own baffling puzzle and took off,
the youthful amateur pilot reported to Dick,
from a spy-hole in the greenery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Sandy knows Jeff has come on to
take his airplane off,&rdquo; Dick mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to go and see. If Mr. Whiteside
is on the estate it will look as though we came
out extra early. Besides, I&rsquo;m hungrier than
Little Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s wolf. Come on!&rdquo;
Larry led the way from the golf course as he
spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Sandy, long since safe at the hangar, began
to work out his puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody was in this hangar the day Jeff
made his pretended forced landing,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;We saw him. It wasn&rsquo;t a mistake.
We all saw him and that proves he wasn&rsquo;t just
a trick of light in the hangar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than that, he deduced, the man had vanished
and yet, after he was gone, there had come
that unexpected descent of the rolling door
which had first made them think themselves
trapped. Sandy argued, and with good common
sense, that a ghost, in broad sunny daylight,
was a silly way to account for the man. He also
felt that it was equally unjust to credit the drop
of the door to gravity. Friction drums are not
designed to allow the ropes on them to slip, especially
if there is no jolt or jar to shake them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the switches that control the motor for
the drum are right out on the wall in plain
sight,&rdquo; he told himself, moving over toward
them, since the rolling door was left wide open
when the amphibian was taken out. &ldquo;Yes, here
they all are&mdash;this one up for lifting the door,
and down to drop it. And that switch was in
the neutral&mdash;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&mdash;position when we were first
here&mdash;and it&rsquo;s in neutral now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>He tapped the metal with the rubber end of
his fountain pan and then shook its vulcanite
grip-handle, to see if jarring it caused any possible
particles of wire or of metal to make a
contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he decided.</p>
<p>He stood before the small switch panel, considering
the problem.</p>
<p>His eyes, in that position, were almost on a
level with the pole-pieces to which wires were
joined to enable the switch metal, when thrust
between the flat pole contacts, to make contact
and complete the electrical circuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m-m!&rdquo; Sandy emitted a long, reflective
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw double wires&mdash;and twisted
around each other, at that,&rdquo; he remarked under
his breath. &ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m not quite right. The two
wires aren&rsquo;t twisted around each other. One
wire is twined around the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He traced the wires down into the metal,
asbestos-lined sheathing cable, and was still not
enlightened about the discovery. It was not necessary
to have two wires. One was heavy enough
for the hundred-and-ten volt current that came
in from the mains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wire, being twined around the other,
makes me think it was added&mdash;after the first
one was put in,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could trace it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>He tried.</p>
<p>Sandy, when he turned around, ten minutes
later, knew all that the inside of the haunted
hangar could reveal.</p>
<p>Another five minutes, concentrated close to
a certain spot on the outside of the building,
gave him his final clue.</p>
<p>But instead of waiting to tell his chums his
great discovery, instead of keeping vigil, Sandy
went away from there as fast as he could walk.</p>
<p>All afternoon he was as busy as a boy trying
to keep ten tops spinning!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">NIGHT IN THE HANGAR</span></h2>
<p>Never was a returning prodigal greeted with
more delight than was Sandy when, close to
dusk, with a parcel under his arm, he joined
Dick and Larry inside a little Summer house
in the Everdail estate grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; demanded Larry.
&ldquo;We hunted high and low! We thought something
had happened to you when we saw Jeff
fly his airplane away, came here and didn&rsquo;t locate
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you. But I&rsquo;ve been
awfully busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing what, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following farmer boys down hot, sunny furrows
while they picked vegetables for market,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following farmer boys? What in the world
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ask them if their fathers would buy a
book on family crests and have their coat of
arms thrown in free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your head, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The youngest Sky Patrol grinned, and shook
his head in question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Larry. It was an excuse to get them
talking. I got the book out of Mr. Everdail&rsquo;s
library and used it to make them think I was a
subscription agent&mdash;so I could ask questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask&mdash;questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Larry spoke together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; demanded Larry, and Dick
nodded to show he wanted an answer also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;about who is related to who, and family
scandals, and who works for this one and
that one&mdash;just &lsquo;gossip&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick caught the impish youth by his shoulders
and shook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that! Tell us where you&rsquo;ve been and
what you did? We&rsquo;ve worried ourselves sick,
nearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he became really serious.</p>
<p>He had been all over that section of the farm-lands,
he asserted, to see if he could pick up
any information that would give him some connection
between either Mr. Whiteside or Jeff, or
the mysterious seaplane passenger&mdash;and Mimi
or the yacht stewardess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew that, I thought we could start
patching clues together,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;Because
Jeff has a lot to do with this mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;But
what started you off on that track?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking an arm of each, Sandy led them, wordless,
up the path.</p>
<p>Spying carefully to be sure that Mr. Whiteside
was not in sight, and being certain that no
one else was watching, Sandy led his chums into
the hangar.</p>
<p>Across to one of its longer sides he led them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the switches that work the rolling
door motor, you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sandy. What?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at them before it gets too dark, Dick.
Do you see anything strange? You know as
much about wiring circuits as I do. We both
built amateur short-wave sending and receiving
sets. You, too, Larry. What isn&rsquo;t right
about the switches or&mdash;the wires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus guided, both studied the switches.</p>
<p>All Larry saw was that the wires were of a
braided form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;are they?&rdquo; He pulled a wire out a
trifle from the sheath.</p>
<p>Then his comrades observed what had first
attracted Sandy&rsquo;s attention, puzzled him and led
to further search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>One wire, somewhat lighter in its insulation
than the other, was wound around the heavier
one. They traced it, as Sandy had done. It
seemed to wind on down, as did others he
showed, from each switch-pole, into the protective
sheathing of metal and insulation; but none
really were wound any further. From there
on down, they ran behind the other wires!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bend down, close to the floor,&rdquo; urged Sandy.
&ldquo;See all the dust and lint piled up?&rdquo; He scraped
some aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry. &ldquo;Golly-gracious-gosh-gravy-granny!
The wires come out from
behind the sheath and turn along the floor, close
to the wall&mdash;and there&rsquo;s dust all covering them!
No wonder we didn&rsquo;t notice them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do they lead to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow the dust line, Dick,&rdquo; Sandy urged.</p>
<p>Back along the hangar wall they crept, until
they came up to the small wooden cupboard with
its dusty, frayed protecting burlap across the
front. Under the cupboard boards the wires
ran well concealed by more dusty lint which
seemed to have been swept into the corners by
the lazy act of some cleaner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Inside here&mdash;but don&rsquo;t use a light&mdash;inside
here, there are smaller duplicate switches for
the electric light arc and the motors,&rdquo; Sandy
informed his breathless, admiring cronies.</p>
<p>They easily proved it. More, they located
the wiring in the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does Jeff get in and out of here?&rdquo;
asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to go outside so I can show you
what I discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trooping around to the rear, at one corner,
Sandy bade them bend down and examine the
bolted metal sheaths, large plates of sheet iron,
that composed the walls of the edifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; objected Dick, dejected
that he had not been as quick of wit as
had his younger chum. &ldquo;But, then, you saw it
first by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; Sandy gave them all the
information he had. &ldquo;I saw a break in the
paint, only up one-half of this big plate of iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bottom half pushed inward,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;It has hinges fixed to the inner part
so it will lift up into the hangar and we can
creep in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proved it, and they followed him through
the fairly low orifice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, as Dick, last to crawl in,
cleared the edge of the metal, &ldquo;see how clever
this is&mdash;the inside of the two plates it has to
come down against are fixed with something
soft&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s felt&mdash;to keep the plate from
clanging. It fits so well that the only way I
found out about it was by the sun making the
dent in the paint show up a few little bright
worn spots of bare metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They complimented him with no trace of envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Jeff did this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Larry, he said he flew over here at
night. He chews gum and we saw how fast he
chewed the day he pretended to be forced to
land here. He knew all about the emeralds.
And the most telling thing against him is that
his wife&mdash;Mimi&mdash;is Mrs. Everdail&rsquo;s maid and
was on the yacht&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mimi his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy nodded at Dick&rsquo;s exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Serena saw her run in her uniform,&rdquo;
contributed Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you discover she was Jeff&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking to farmer boys&mdash;what they didn&rsquo;t
know, they found out from their older sisters
when any of them were picking up early potatoes
or snipping asparagus or digging up
onions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;golly&mdash;gosh&mdash;gracious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Sandy agreed with Larry&rsquo;s exclamations but
urged his chums to leave the hangar: they knew
all it could tell them. He wanted to replace the
book he had used and get away from the hangar
for awhile.</p>
<p>In the old, disused house, to which Mr. Whiteside
had secured a set of keys for them so they
need not hang around the grounds until there
was work to be done, they talked in low tones.
Sandy believed that Jeff had coaxed his wife to
put acid on the gems in the London hotel, as
had been done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be as much of a fanatic as that,&rdquo;
admitted Larry, but not with any great delight&mdash;he
had always liked Jeff. &ldquo;He is as superstitious
as a heathen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the maid knew those weren&rsquo;t the real
gems!&rdquo; Dick remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know she did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. But somebody said she did, or
thought she must know the real ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t prove she did, Dick. The real
ones were hardly ever removed from safe deposit,&rdquo;
Sandy argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did she throw over that life preserver?&mdash;&rdquo;
and as he began the inquiry Larry
saw the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;saw&mdash;the&mdash;captain hide&mdash;the real
gems!&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff didn&rsquo;t use the amphibian, though. And
he brought us here and induced us to aid him,
saying we were helping Mr. Everdail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dick supplemented Larry&rsquo;s new point.
&ldquo;Another thing, Sandy, that doesn&rsquo;t explain
why he&rsquo;d take three boys and fly a ship he could
never use on water&mdash;with an amphibian right
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only saying what I believe. I don&rsquo;t
know very much. But what I do know points to
Jeff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t get the life preserver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Sandy agreed, Jeff did not expect to do
that. He argued that Jeff must have planned
to superintend the affair, while the man in the
seaplane with Tommy Larsen secured the gems,
whereupon Jeff could chase him, probably turn
on him and get the emeralds, and then pretend
on his return that the man had gotten safely
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t need to guess,&rdquo; Sandy said.
&ldquo;Before I began asking questions I met Jeff on
the way here.&rdquo; He explained what made him
suspect the man who said he must repair his
&ldquo;stalled&rdquo; engine with a bolt that he knew was
not made&mdash;a slotted bolt. &ldquo;I slipped down
across that estate to the inlet and saw the
amphibian. And Mr. Whiteside was in it, supervising
the filling of its tank!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he means to get away with Jeff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No he doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Larry, sharply. &ldquo;Here
he comes onto the lawn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretending to be unaware of the arrival, the
Sky Patrol issued from the house.</p>
<p>They saw that Mr. Whiteside carried a life
preserver. In black on its side was painted
&ldquo;<i>Tramp</i>, New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sky Patrol&mdash;and Ground Crew,&rdquo; he
hailed them. &ldquo;We are going to see some excitement
at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Dick amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to trap the real culprit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By watching in and around the hangar to-night&mdash;and
this time our bait will be this life
preserver that I discovered in the swamp. I
guessed the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; was searching the amphibian
and the seaplane for the right life preserver.
I devised a plan to get rid of the caretaker
while Jeff and I made a complete, exhaustive
search, this noon. We found nothing; so
Jeff flew me over the swamp and we got&mdash;this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open it!&rdquo; urged Sandy, all his former
suspicions gone in his eagerness. &ldquo;We can take
out the emeralds and then put the empty doughnut
in place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. We won&rsquo;t tamper with it. I want to
deliver it, intact, to Atley Everdail. His is the
right to open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a risk?&rdquo; Sandy objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Dick will watch inside the hangar,
Larry and I by the doors. Sandy will be in or
near the amphibian. If Jeff is the culprit we&rsquo;ll
soon know&mdash;if he had a confederate we will discover
that, perhaps, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Jeff at all&mdash;and I hope it won&rsquo;t
be,&rdquo; Larry said, &ldquo;if it turns out to be the seaplane
passenger who discovered that in his terror
he chute-jumped with the wrong belt, and he
comes to hunt the right one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or if it is Captain Parks, or his mate, or a
seaman&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside began to chuckle as
he led them toward the dark loom of the hangar,
&ldquo;Or&mdash;even if it turns out to be&mdash;me!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you walk under a ladder, today, sir?&rdquo;
asked Sandy seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo; The man stared at him through
the night. &ldquo;What makes you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Jeff did&mdash;he walked under a ladder
where a man was pruning a tree as he came to
the gate of the estate next door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm! Then&mdash;if he&rsquo;s as superstitious as he
makes believe,&rdquo; Larry laughed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d better
watch out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had that!&rdquo; Sandy agreed.</p>
<p>And Dick, as they entered the hangar, rolled
down the doors, set the switch at neutral and he
was alone with Sandy in the pitchy blackness,
echoed the sentiment.</p>
<p>A new idea flashed into Sandy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he spoke through the darkness.
&ldquo;Dick, we&rsquo;re not watching that amphibian
at all! If Jeff did come here and managed
to get away, he&rsquo;d go straight there and fly
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick agreed, declared that with Larry and
Mr. Whiteside within call he dared to wait in
the hangar alone, and Sandy, going out through
the secret way, encountered Larry and the
detective, consulted them, had their sanction for
his idea and hurried off toward the next estate.</p>
<p>Thus divided up, the Sky Patrol spent dull
hours waiting.</p>
<p>But patience is always rewarded!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">SANDY&rsquo;S TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Wearisome though his vigil was, Sandy made
the best he could of it by going over all
the events that had happened.</p>
<p>With his chums he had become friendly with
Jeff at the newly opened municipal airport. Jeff
had flown them to the old estate, pretended that
his motor died, simulated a forced landing, then
explained it all in a way that looked sincere
enough at the time&mdash;but now!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Jeff had been the one to accompany Larry to
the wreck of the seaplane, and to bring the life
preserver back, when he took Tommy Larsen
to the emergency hospital.</p>
<p>One little thing bothered Sandy at that point
in his musing: why had Jeff not made away with
the life preserver at once?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he hadn&rsquo;t seen his wife then,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;Mimi told him her news, about seeing
the captain of the yacht hide the real
jewels&mdash;and being an airman, he hadn&rsquo;t known
that all yacht equipment has its name painted
on it in case of a wreck at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skipping many other things that seemed to
point out Jeff as the ringleader, deceiving his
employer and war buddy, Mr. Everdail, Sandy
came down to the present suspicious circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff left the amphibian here on purpose. Of
course he knows that Mr. Whiteside won&rsquo;t leave
the real jewel &lsquo;preserver&rsquo; unguarded here, but
he must know the plan to have it in the hangar.
He thinks he is clever enough to outwit us all&mdash;but
Jeff,&rdquo; he addressed the imaginary image of
the pilot, &ldquo;you walked under a ladder, today.
Don&rsquo;t forget how superstitious you are. And&mdash;this
time&mdash;it is an omen, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cut short his meditation and listened to
the sound of oars in the inlet.</p>
<p>Was Mr. Whiteside coming&mdash;or Jeff?</p>
<p>His uncertainty was not maintained for long.</p>
<p>Making no effort to be quiet, the oarsman
sculled to one of the steps arranged for embarking
on the amphibian in water, looped a line
around a strut to hold his boat against the drift
of slack tide and a slight wind, and came onto
the amphibian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Sandy, crouched low in the passenger&rsquo;s cockpit,
hoping Jeff would not notice him, was dazzled
by the beam of a searchlight pocket lamp
which Jeff flashed around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed, surprised. &ldquo;What are
you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the plan?&rdquo; Sandy wanted to
take advantage of Jeff&rsquo;s momentary indecision:
perhaps he would &ldquo;give away&rdquo; something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah! I know what Whiteside planned. But
he didn&rsquo;t plan for anybody to be here. What&rsquo;s
the need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case the&mdash;ghost&mdash;got away from the
others and knew this airplane was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy got a shock of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that-there is so! And if the gas-boat
come and filled up the tank&mdash;I sent it, this afternoon
and that was what Whiteside stayed here
for, to see that the &lsquo;phib&rsquo; got gassed and oiled
up&mdash;the&mdash;ghost&mdash;could use it, if that-there
ghost was a pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff chuckled rather sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you suspect me. I
know you have, ever since the start of this business&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I did.&rdquo; Sandy thought fast: he decided
to clear Jeff&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you remember
that I turned over a new leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish your buddies and that-there Whiteside
would do as much, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy could not find anything to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Jeff remarked. &ldquo;This-here
psychology I&rsquo;ve read about ain&rsquo;t so far wrong
when it says that folks who gets the wrong slant
on a thing comes to believe it so strong that
even the truth looks like a fib to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Jeff turned and found his way
back to the rowboat. &ldquo;Time will tell. I seen a
flock of birds circle over my head this afternoon
and that-there is a sure sign of good fortune.
I&rsquo;ll come out cleared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no further word he sculled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; he called over his shoulder,
&ldquo;if you can suspect me, I can suspect you&mdash;and
Whiteside&mdash;and Dick&mdash;and Larry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, without reply, was already quietly undressing.</p>
<p>When the boat touched the wharf Sandy was
a tiny figure moving with careful strokes
through the water, screened by the amphibian
as he swam for a sandy outcrop of the shore
not far beyond the flying craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The dark figure of the pilot, moving across
the estate shore paths had, at a good distance
behind it, a shadow. Sandy had managed to
hold his bundled clothes enough out of water to
be fairly dry.</p>
<p>Over to the disused estate the quarry and its
watchful shadow moved.</p>
<p>The pilot turned up a slope and climbed the
smooth turf.</p>
<p>Sandy, waiting until he got to a shrubbery,
moved so it was between him and his quarry.
He, too, crossed the ascending turf.</p>
<p>It startled Sandy to see Jeff turn in at the old
house, climb the veranda steps, cross the porch
to the door&mdash;and go in.</p>
<p>Sandy stayed behind some shrubbery.</p>
<p>Jeff could watch from the doorway. He might
see a figure in the open space of the lawn around
the house.</p>
<p>He thought he guessed Jeff&rsquo;s ruse.</p>
<p>The pilot, he reasoned, would go through the
house after seeing that no one seemed to be following;
but to be doubly sure he would go on to
the front, coming out there, or to the side opposite
where he had entered. Sandy matched
his plans to the chance. He went, Indian-still
and crouched, to a point where an ornamental
tree would be in line with his movement from
the side door, then in that shelter moved back
to the hedged path, bent low and ran down to a
cross path that took him to another point of the
grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>From that he could observe the whole lawn
around the house.</p>
<p>But, when a half hour had elapsed and no one
had come out, he was puzzled. Had his maneuver
been executed too late? No, Jeff could not have
gotten out of sight because the lawn was too
wide to cross in the brief time Sandy used up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the house&mdash;doing what?&rdquo; he wondered.</p>
<p>He did not dare to find out. That &ldquo;what&rdquo;
might be answered by &ldquo;watching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once he thought he caught a glint of light in
the library window; but it could have come from
a high beam of some automobile headlight, on
the distant highway that passed the estate.</p>
<p>So Sandy watched and waited.</p>
<p>Therefore he did not see the dark figure that
emerged cautiously from the grove and, with intent,
careful gaze, studied the hangar.</p>
<p>The ghost was getting ready to walk!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">DICK ENCOUNTERS THE &ldquo;GHOST&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>When Dick had tried crouching, sitting on his
heels, walking and every other device he could
think of to end the interminable difficulties of
trying to pass time with nothing to do and nothing
under him but the hard cement hangar floor,
he began to wish he had never met Jeff or gotten
into the adventure at all.</p>
<p>He resolved, then and there, never to become
a detective.</p>
<p>Countless times his nerves had been pulled by
sounds which turned out on second thought to
be only the contracting of the hot metal, subjected
to the sun all day, as the evening breeze
robbed it of its warmth.</p>
<p>No wonder that he failed to react to a slight
clinking, hardly more than would be made by
the scratch of wire in a lock.</p>
<p>But the shrinking of metal had made intermittent
noises, sharp and not repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>This sound, so insistent, so prolonged, began,
at last, to make an impression. &ldquo;Now what can
that be?&rdquo; he wondered, becoming strained in his
effort to make his ears serve him to the fullest
degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a rat&rsquo;s claws,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;There
aren&rsquo;t any rats. There&rsquo;s nothing to draw them,
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the emission of a sharper click from some
unlocated point he felt his spine chill, his nerves
grew tense and a queer, uneasy feeling ran over
his muscles, an involuntary tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could make such a sound?&rdquo; he pondered.</p>
<p>Then he drew his legs in under him as he sat
with his back against the metal sheathing of a
corner.</p>
<p>The small, side door, toward the Sound shore,
was opening!</p>
<p>That was a complication for which nothing
had been planned. Larry and Mr. Whiteside,
Dick knew, were lying in the shadow of the
hedge behind the hangar, watching the cleverly
devised back entry way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Because it had been supposed that the
&ldquo;ghost&rdquo;&mdash;Jeff&mdash;or whoever it was, would use
that means of getting in, Dick&rsquo;s own position
had been chosen. He had selected a place sharply
diagonal in direction from it. In his corner
he could not be seen in the beam of a flashlight
from the small cupboard unless its user came all
the way out: otherwise the sides would shape
the path of the light so it would not come near
him.</p>
<p>But a man or ghost entering from the side,
and playing any light around, would show Dick
fully exposed.</p>
<p>The worst of that was that there was no rear
guard flanking that door!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dick thought. &ldquo;I can only wait and
see what happens&mdash;and be ready to chase if I
am discovered. Maybe I can catch and hold the
&lsquo;ghost&rsquo; till the others get to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Careful not to scrape his soles in the cement,
he gathered himself into a crouching, compact,
alert figure.</p>
<p>Dim and hardly distinct to his straining eyes,
there seemed to be in the slightly lighter gloom
of the floor where the door opened, a shadow.</p>
<p>It might be an illusion of his taut nerves and
tense mind, Dick decided.</p>
<p>He could not see out through the opening because
he was almost in a straight line with the
wall on that side.</p>
<p>He waited, becoming shaky with the strain,
for what seemed like a dragging eternity.</p>
<p>The intruder must be scanning the landscape,
judging conditions, he guessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>When it seemed that he could not stay as he
was another instant, the door was slightly
moved, and then softly closed. So quiet was the
operation that he did not hear the latch click.
He had detected no change in the color of the
door itself as it hung, slantwise to his view, and
he heard no sound of feet on the cement.</p>
<p>That meant nothing fearful or horrifying to
Dick.</p>
<p>Rubber soles and a dark suit covered the
logical explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, I should have seen his face&mdash;maybe a
mask, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At any rate, he knew that he was not alone inside
the edifice, and if Dick&rsquo;s common sense was
too great to let him think of uncanny spirits, the
sense of danger supplied chills and thrills
a-plenty.</p>
<p>A faint, glowing, bluish light broke out.</p>
<p>It threw no beam, only a sort of dull phosphorescence;
but Dick&rsquo;s quick eyes ran instantly
to its source&mdash;some small flashlamp covered
with colored cloth, a handkerchief, perhaps.</p>
<p>Behind that silhouette, because the light was
aimed in the direction away from Dick, he saw
what caused him to emit a revealing gasp.</p>
<p>The figure silhouette between him and the
glow wore a dress!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; gasped Dick, and at the same instant
the figure whirled, Dick leaped up, the
light went out and Dick rushed blindly forward.</p>
<p>A hand fumbled with the catch: that located
her.</p>
<p>In his rush, Dick&rsquo;s arms were carried around
the shoulders he could not see. Like a serpent,
sinuous, tense, powerful, the woman squirmed
around in his arms.</p>
<p>He tried to hold her with one hand as he
strove to open that door with the other, while he
took the beating of her furious hands on his
bent face.</p>
<p>The door catch yielded&mdash;their wrestling,
struggling weight drew it inward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help&mdash;this way!&rdquo; screamed Dick.</p>
<p>And he clung like a terrier to a tigress!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><span class="small">A TRIUMPH FOR THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>Sandy was first to hear the call and locate it.
The others, not expecting a cry for help from
within the hangar until they had seen some one
go in, when Dick would be only a sort of surprise
attacker while they proposed to make the capture,
Larry and the detective were confused for
an instant.</p>
<p>Then, recovering, and supposing Dick had
called from close inside the hangar, they took
the quickest way in, and interfered with one another
at the small opening in the plates.</p>
<p>Sandy, dashing toward the hangar, correctly
supposing Dick had called from its smaller
doorway, did not see Jeff emerge from the old
house and start on a run in the same direction.</p>
<p>Dick, clinging with all his strength to a wiry,
supple powerful body, strove to keep that hold
while he captured the hands that were pounding
at his neck and averted face.</p>
<p>Hot, quick puffs of breath fanned his cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Hissing, sibilant gasps marked the throes of
the struggle.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly the figure went limp.</p>
<p>Dick clung. He heard the aides coming in
through the metal opening. He caught the
pound of Sandy&rsquo;s approaching shoes.</p>
<p>But he did not believe he had made his captive
so tamely surrender.</p>
<p>He realized that with a hand at her side the
woman was striving to get at something in her
skirt.</p>
<p>He slipped his arm down lower so that his
hand encountered her wrist.</p>
<p>That lessened his ability to hold with the arm
that was already aching from its prolonged
strain. His hand gripped convulsively in the
folds of the dress at the back; but his grip was
not as tight as it had been because his mind was
concentrated on stopping that other hand!</p>
<p>He felt a knee coming up.</p>
<p>Involuntarily he shrank back from a possible
kick in some vital spot.</p>
<p>Like a cat the figure squirmed, a heel, small
and sharp, came down on his foot. He grunted
and winced and the figure broke his grip.</p>
<p>Pushing him, leaping backward, only to catch
balance, the form wheeled on agile feet and ran
for the grove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Sandy, within sighting distance, cut into the
wood to intersect the path of flight.</p>
<p>Dick pounded after the woman.</p>
<p>From the door of the hangar Larry and Mr.
Whiteside emerged to join the chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could have held her one second more!&mdash;&rdquo;
panted Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her?&rdquo; cried Larry.</p>
<p>The grove had prevented him from seeing the
escaping figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mimi, I guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all disappeared into the grove, and Jeff,
coming rapidly closer, paused to listen to the
sound of the pursuit.</p>
<p>A smile, inscrutable in the dark, crossed his
face, twisted his lips. He turned into the hangar.</p>
<p>Down the wood&rsquo;s path raced Dick, Larry
slightly ahead of him, the detective, older and
not so quick, bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scatter!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;She has turned off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is&mdash;&rdquo; Sandy shouted, but a crash
indicated that he had stumbled or missed his
footing on slippery sod or pebbles.</p>
<p>The chase turned toward him.</p>
<p>Recovered, he dashed in pursuit of the
woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>Their quarry was fleet, clever and terrorized:
she led them always toward the water, down
hill.</p>
<p>Sandy, having hurt his foot somewhat in his
stumble, was quickly out of the race.</p>
<p>He decided to go back and see if the hangar,
with its door wide, was still deserted. Sandy
had a misgiving that the woman might be a
decoy and that the hangar ought to be watched.</p>
<p>As Dick passed at a slight distance, Sandy
told his idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;so,&rdquo; panted Dick. He decided that
the other two must be both fleeter and more
agile than he, with his fat; so he returned with
Sandy, to a point where they saw that the door
was in the same relative position they had left
it&mdash;wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need to stay here&mdash;both of
us,&rdquo; Sandy said. &ldquo;And if Jeff went into the
house, he may have come out. Suppose he plans
to get hold of that life preserver, and the woman
was sent ahead to get us all away&mdash;&rdquo; He considered
that, then went back to his original idea,
&ldquo;Then it would be a good thing for me to get
back to where I can watch that amphibian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick agreed.</p>
<p>He went inside the hangar, closing the door,
and resumed his vigil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>In a short time two others returned, to knock
on the door and to inform Dick, when he opened
it, that the woman, clever planner that she
proved herself, had arranged the small motor-boat
of the estate so that its engine was going;
by a ruse she had gotten far enough ahead of
them while they stopped to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; her discarded
coat after she had cried out as if she had
stumbled. That enabled her to get to the boat.
They had no way to overtake her as she swept
out of the inlet. Evidently she had started the
boat motor in the afternoon while they were
away, or they would have heard the roar of the
start though no one had noticed the softer purr
of it as it idled.</p>
<p>Then they went into the hangar and Mr.
Whiteside, listening to Dick&rsquo;s report, from
Sandy, of Jeff&rsquo;s movements, swung his flashlamp
around.</p>
<p>From each came an amazed, horrified gasp.</p>
<p>The life preserver was gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><span class="small">A DOUBLE PURSUIT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your heads, boys,&rdquo; counseled Mr.
Whiteside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will&mdash;but come on&mdash;Jeff&rsquo;s making for
the amphibian&mdash;let&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy went back to guard it,&rdquo; Dick told
Larry who had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone is Sandy on watch, but I arranged
to have Tommy Larsen bring his airplane to the
golf green Jeff used this afternoon,&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside
told them, as he walked, recovering breath,
toward the hangar door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy is to keep his engine warm, idling,
and to be ready, at the first sign of escape, to
take the air and overtake Jeff,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But maybe Sandy might get into trouble,&rdquo;
urged Larry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d fight to stop Jeff, and that
man is in a dangerous mood if he&rsquo;d do what he
has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do no harm to go over,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Whiteside, slamming the door behind them.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shorter down along the water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>At a jog trot they went down the slope and at
the wharf Dick gave a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the motor boat&mdash;drifting just off the
dock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that woman&mdash;Mimi&mdash;came back to rejoin
Jeff!&rdquo; argued Larry, and broke into a run.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the wharf path they ran, turning into
the shell-powder path that skirted the inlet on
the far side of which the amphibian lay moored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy will stop them,&rdquo; panted Dick, a little
to the rear because of his weight. Larry called,
over his shoulder, that with two to give battle to,
Sandy might need them before they could arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody&mdash;on the lawn!&rdquo; cried
Dick, swinging off in that direction. From behind
a large tree emerged a figure. Larry and
the detective followed at a run. But the man
who came quickly forward to meet them gave all
three a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy!&rdquo; Larry recognized the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larsen, why aren&rsquo;t you by your airplane?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Whiteside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came over to report and get instructions,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I gave&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something new has come up, sir. I was waiting
there by my ship a good while back, and I
heard another one cruising and spiraling, shooting
the field, I guess, because he came in and set
down. My crate, just the way you ordered, was
down by the grove, not in plain sight in the middle
of the course. But Jeff set his ship down,
left the engine running, and went off. I stayed
hid to see what would happen, but when he
didn&rsquo;t come back, I thought I&rsquo;d better go and
find you&mdash;and see if it meant anything to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff&rsquo;s working with his wife, we think,&rdquo;
volunteered Larry. &ldquo;Anyhow a woman slipped
in and led us out of the hangar and started away
in a motor boat, and then she must have come
back, because yonder&rsquo;s the boat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything of Mimi?&rdquo; asked Mr. Whiteside
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t laid eyes on the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have met Jeff and gone with him.
We&rsquo;re going to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have orders, at that,&rdquo; Mr. Whiteside told
the pilot. &ldquo;You go back and get into the air and
then cruise around&mdash;just in case Jeff does get
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take him some time,&rdquo; argued Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;He could start his motor and taxi while it
warmed up, and be half across the Sound before
he took off if he wanted to, in that &lsquo;phib,&rsquo;&rdquo; the
pilot said. Turning, he called that he would get
going, and returned beyond their view beyond
the trees.</p>
<p>Dick, Larry and Mr. Whiteside, listening for
a call from Sandy, went hurrying along. But no
call from Sandy. He had decided that it would
be a wiser thing to hide than to risk doing battle
with the pilot if he was actually as bad as they
suspected; with that in mind he had crawled in
through the opening from the back, into the
fuselage of the amphibian. There, fairly comfortable,
he lay, full length, listening. The open
top allowed air to come because a strong, puffy
breeze had gotten up, driving great, black thunderclouds
before it.</p>
<p>Sandy regretted his ruse presently, because
he heard a boat and realized that he could not
see who occupied it: furthermore, while his position
would enable him to be hidden and to go
along if Jeff took off, he would be helpless in
case of an accident to the craft.</p>
<p>When he decided to get out, it was almost too
late&mdash;but not quite.</p>
<p>Jeff got his engine going by setting it on a
compression point when he had primed the
cylinders and using his booster magneto to furnish
the hot sparks that gave it its first impulse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Then, as soon as he heard Jeff drop the mooring
rope and get in, Sandy backed to a point
where he could crawl to hands and knees, poked
his head up carefully, saw Jeff, adjusting his
helmet as the engine roared, and was able to
climb over the seat back into the place behind the
tank before Jeff decided they were warmed up
enough, got the craft on the step and lifted it
into the darkness, lit by intermittent flashes of
approaching lightning.</p>
<p>Sandy snapped his safety belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mister Jeff,&rdquo; he remarked, safe behind
the roar of their climb. &ldquo;Go anywhere you
like&mdash;life preserver and all. I&rsquo;ll make the
tracks &lsquo;sandy&rsquo; for you if you want to stop!&rdquo; He
employed a railway expression, whimsically
applying it to the airplane instead.</p>
<p>Dick, Larry and the detective, hearing the
roar of the engine, delayed not a moment in
their dash around the rest of the inlet shore.</p>
<p>They found that the amphibian was well out
on the Sound, saw it lift.</p>
<p>It climbed in a northerly direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>As they reached the vicinity of its starting
point and called and searched for Sandy, they
heard the drone of another engine and saw the
red-and-green and the white flying lights of
what must be Tommy&rsquo;s craft, also going
northerly in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo; Larry cried. &ldquo;There must
be some place in Connecticut that Jeff and the
woman with him know about&mdash;remember, Tommy&rsquo;s
passenger had him flying in that direction
when the seaplane crashed, and the hydroplane
boat went that way&mdash;by gracious-golly-gravy!
Do you suppose it could have been the woman
who ran off with that other life preserver, while
Jeff pretended he was too sick to take up a
ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering
more about Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the house and make sure he
didn&rsquo;t stop there to see what Jeff had been doing
before,&rdquo; Larry suggested. &ldquo;He may have
missed going with Jeff. If the woman had been
along he&rsquo;d have had no place and they would
have left him here. But there isn&rsquo;t a trace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No signs of any struggle either,&rdquo; said the
detective who had investigated with his flash.</p>
<p>They returned to the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>In the library, where Sandy had told Dick he
had seen a glimmer of light, they saw nothing
especially unusual, unless they could attach importance
to an old photograph album, lying
open on a corner settee with several small snapshots
removed and only the gummed stickers
left to show they had been there and what their
size was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Sandy,&rdquo; said Dick, worried. &ldquo;Do you
suppose they?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he saw two people coming and
crawled into the fuselage,&rdquo; Larry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have. I wish we could follow and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready&mdash;and I think I&rsquo;d be safe to fly,
even if it does look like storms. We could outfly
Jeff, anyhow, catch up with him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to an open telephone book beside
the instrument on the side table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Long Distance book, too&mdash;and its open
at the E&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Dick glanced swiftly down the
pages, &ldquo;Evedall&mdash;Ever&mdash;Everdail!&rdquo; he looked
up with a surprised face.</p>
<p>Instantly Larry caught up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long Distance Operator, please,&rdquo; he spoke
into the transmitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long Distance?&rdquo; He gave the number of the
Everdail Maine estate, secured from the open
book. &ldquo;Has that number been called recently?
Can you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; came back to him.</p>
<p>The moment became two&mdash;three&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! It has! At ten o&rsquo;clock. Thank you.
Someone has been using our house telephone,
then. Goodbye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was called!&rdquo; the detective showed a baffled
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by Jeff!&rdquo; Larry consulted his watch.
&ldquo;The time checks with the report Sandy gave
that Jeff was here. He called Mr. Everdail&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell him about the life preserver&mdash;and
maybe to deliver it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dick&mdash;he would never take it there if he
means to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to think he doesn&rsquo;t mean to make
away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it had to be a pilot who did all the
things we have evidence of, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;there&rsquo;s another pilot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s flying after Jeff!&rdquo; gasped the
detective&mdash;leaping up he started out. &ldquo;Come,
boys&mdash;Larry, will you try to fly us? I&rsquo;ve been on
the wrong angle all along. Will you take us in
Jeff&rsquo;s airplane, Larry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry would!</p>
<p>Jacketed from the supply Jeff kept for passengers,
two of the Sky Patrol and a discomfited
detective rose in the air and joined the pursuit.</p>
<p>It was to have an unexpected outcome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII
<br /><span class="small">A BATTLE ABOVE THE CLOUDS</span></h2>
<p>Hour after hour, into a North wind that cut
down their forward mileage somewhat, Larry
held the airplane.</p>
<p>He flew low, in order to hold the coastline of
the ocean, because he did not dare try to navigate,
inexperienced as he was, with no practice
at &ldquo;blind flying&rdquo; above the clouds.</p>
<p>Thunderstorms menaced, but always they
were to the inland side, and Larry did not have
to pass through them, or climb above them and
lose his way.</p>
<p>Boston, easily recognized for its expanse and
illumination, as well as by the name-markers on
certain roofs, painted there by air-minded owners,
finally came into view.</p>
<p>They circled until Larry located the large airport
there.</p>
<p>Noting its white boundary lights, its red
warnings, its windsock to give him the direction
of the air currents, he circled the field several
times, to be sure he would not foul any other
ship, and to see if any signal would be sent him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Presently, after a commercial freight carrier
had taken off, he got two red lights, a signal to
land, and as the field was wonderfully well
lighted, and he had learned to judge distance
from the ground well, Larry was repaid for his
self-control and confidence and care by making
a perfect three-point landing.</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside&rsquo;s explanations seemed to clear
away need for formality.</p>
<p>While they were gassing up the airplane, he
went to the administration building and chatted
with the field manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others are still ahead of us,&rdquo; he reported
to Larry and Dick as they munched a hurried
meal and drank hot coffee, also securing additional
flying togs to supplement what they had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how much we&rsquo;ve caught up on
them,&rdquo; Larry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the amphibian stayed only a few minutes,
and it wasn&rsquo;t gone five minutes before the
other one came in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A two-place biplane?&rdquo; asked Larry.</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside nodded.</p>
<p>It remained only to get information, he
stated, and then went up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;I gave Tommy
orders to ride down Jeff if he had to, in order to
stop him, and to get him arrested. I wish I
could stop him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was in the first &rsquo;plane?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy was there&mdash;they saw a boy, and Jeff
got him some gloves; and they seemed surprisingly
friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means that Jeff is innocent and has
made friends with Sandy; but where is the
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answering Dick, Mr. Whiteside explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was in the second airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Tommy!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s
the one we want to catch, as well as to save Jeff
and Sandy from being driven down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wasted no time.</p>
<p>Friendly pilots, considering Larry such a boy
aviator as Bobby Buck had proved to be, gave
him some instructions that were most valuable,
concerning night flying. The wind would be dead
ahead, for most of his trip toward Maine, and
he could check his direction by that until he had
to veer to the West of North, when the wind,
quartering, would drift him off the course&mdash;but
they gave him rough corrections, and advised
him to get above the clouds that were bearing
down on Boston&mdash;local thunder storms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Once more the low-wing craft took the air,
climbed to a good height, Larry used his instructions,
got the nose into the wind and drove
ahead.</p>
<p>Slowly, as the distance behind them increased,
their distance behind the other two ships grew
less. Minute by minute they cut their handicap.
Dick strained his eyes ahead, and to either side,
watchful, eager.</p>
<p>He said almost nothing into the Gossport tube
he had at his lips.</p>
<p>Larry knew his business: Dick wore the instructor&rsquo;s
part of the outfit only because it was
the only helmet they could get at the start.</p>
<p>Under them black clouds, torn by vivid
streaks of blue-white light, reeled backward,
their tops tumbling and tossing.</p>
<p>Above them the night sky shone serene, with
the full moon, just nicked by the curve of old
Mother earth, riding higher and higher.</p>
<p>That was a glorious picture, had any one of
them had the wish to enjoy it. But they were
intent on much more important sights than that
of a lovely sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying lights ahead&mdash;&rdquo; Dick spoke excitedly
into the Gossport tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two sets&mdash;&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Larry moved the throttle forward as far as it
would go.</p>
<p>He peered ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! There they are! Just a little below our
level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closer and closer they approached. The two
airplanes were vividly visible in the bright
light reflected upward also from the fleecy tops
of wind-tossed cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re stunting&mdash;&rdquo; Dick gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not stunting,&rdquo; Larry forgot his voice
would not reach Dick. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re maneuvering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was clear to him. The amphibian, easily
identified by its clumsy, bulky looking trucks,
with the pontoons slung to braces, was trying
to get away from a relentless biplane which
sought to overtop it, to ride down onto its tail,
force it down.</p>
<p>Two war pilots fought it out above the clouds!</p>
<p>In the airplane with one sat a woman whose
presence marked him for a dangerous character,
after the Everdail emeralds.</p>
<p>Behind the other pilot sat one of the Sky
Patrol, at the mercy of a devilishly minded adversary,
and he was as helpless to save himself
as Larry and Dick were to aid him!</p>
<p>Larry, thinking of that, but hoping against
hope that for all his lack of experience he might
see some opportunity to stop the other man,
banked moderately and began to circle.</p>
<p>They watched, breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>The amphibian, under Jeff&rsquo;s adroit piloting,
side-slipped from under its danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; panted Dick, unaware that his voice
carried through the tube to Larry, who nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to climb higher,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t outclimb the biplane, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry breathed a prayer of thanksgiving.
Sandy was all right, saved for the time being
from danger of being driven down.</p>
<p>A bright idea struck Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Larry,&rdquo; he said into his tube. &ldquo;If
we could fly level with the amphibian, I could
use my flashlight to flick a message to Sandy,
and tell him to lower the life preserver while
we fly directly under his craft, until we catch
it and pull it into our ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry nodded.</p>
<p>With his flashlight flicking the dots and
dashes of the Morse code to Sandy, Dick spelt
out a message explaining his idea. Twice he
flashed the message, got an O. K. from Sandy,
and told Larry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>There were some preparations on the other
skycraft, then Larry dropped the nose of his
plane and went down a few feet. The amphibian
flew over them, high enough so its hanging
pontoons would not scrape their craft, and as
the cockpits were low, it could drop fairly
close.</p>
<p>Sandy leaned out, a doughnut of white came
shaking and swinging at the end of a rope. Dick
braced himself, safety belt snapped tight, arms
extended upward. Larry held his ship at flying
speed and level. Once an air shift dipped the
amphibian dangerously low, but Larry saw it
coming and dived ten feet, then leveled again.
Once more they tried to jockey into position.</p>
<p>Dick saw the doughnut swing toward him,
threw his head back to avoid the blow, but it
struck his chest. With a grunt, his arms closed
and he clung. Sandy, feeling the tug of the
rope, let go.</p>
<p>Dick dragged in the rope to prevent it from
flying back into the empennage, fouling the tail
assembly&mdash;and they had the preserver.</p>
<p>Then Dick shouted a warning. Larry dived.
Tommy was coming at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<h2 id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV
<br /><span class="small">THE EMERALDS ARE FOUND</span></h2>
<p>Larry sent his craft into a sharp dive.
Tommy, trying to prevent the maneuver, came
straight toward the spot they had occupied,
but missed.</p>
<p>Now the clouds hid them. By use of his
instruments he could keep on a level keel,
Larry knew, and with the engine throttled off,
they could not be traced by its roar.</p>
<p>Presently they sailed out into a clear area
and Larry sighed thankfully. He watched for
a landing field beside a lake shaped like a half-moon.
That would tell him he could set down
on the landing spot the millionaire had built
before going West.</p>
<p>Then he saw it. They began to drop swiftly,
coming ever closer to the field. And then they
set down, safe and unmolested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Before the chums were clear of the runway,
Tommy set down his ship, tumbled out and let
the woman with him&mdash;the yacht stewardess&mdash;get
out as best she could. &ldquo;What do you mean,
double-crossing me?&rdquo; screamed Tommy at
detective Whiteside. &ldquo;Why have you tried to
get the emeralds after you promised me half
of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man has gone crazy,&rdquo; said Whiteside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all in it together, Mr. Everdail,&rdquo;
Tommy shouted, turning toward the millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with that stewardess?&rdquo;
demanded Larry. &ldquo;She joined you on the lawn
when you came from behind the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; cried Everdail. &ldquo;We can thresh
it out later. Right now let&rsquo;s get those emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry produced a knife, and Mr. Everdail
slashed the life preserver to ribbons.</p>
<p>There was a gasp. The life preserver was
empty.</p>
<p>Then everyone began to talk at once, as accusations
flew back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss, I want you to take a look at this-here
stuff I brought from your house,&rdquo; said Jeff,
drawing a parcel from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; Sandy was amazed. &ldquo;Jeff,
that&rsquo;s the family history of the Everdails, that
I saw when I visited the farm boys and found
out you and Mimi were married.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;That-there is it,&rdquo; agreed Jeff, taking several
tintypes from an envelope. &ldquo;Boss, read
that history of your family and see if it makes
it plain why anybody wanted to destroy your
gems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the light of a flare, Mr. Everdail perused
the pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; grinned Jeff. &ldquo;Thanks to Sandy
for leaving the book there, and thanks to&mdash;a
certain relative of yours for leaving a marker
at the right place. Now, take a look at these
pictures out of your family album. They are
pictures of the man who originally got the
emeralds in India, and his son. Whose face
that you know is close to being the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the scream of a madman, Mr. Whiteside
leaped to the side of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he babbled. &ldquo;Yes! I am the son of
the branch of your family that originally had
the emeralds. My grandfather, for spite
against my father, willed them to your family.
Those emeralds ought to be mine&mdash;and my
sister&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;here he gestured toward the stewardess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Whiteside Everdail&mdash;as they
now learned his name was&mdash;&ldquo;I grew up hating
Atley Everdail&rsquo;s family. I enlisted in the flying
corps, got into his esquadrille, made a
buddy of him, won his trust!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worked into his confidence, and watched
every chance to get the emeralds. My time
came when his wife went to London. I had my
sister&mdash;stewardess, she was&mdash;already on the
yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beat the yacht to London. With her help&mdash;forced
by threats&mdash;I got into the hotel and
destroyed the gems&mdash;I thought. But on the
way back to my room I saw Captain Parks,
and began to suspect. I compelled my sister
to admit the truth. The real gems were safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to America, made the hinged door
to the hangar, rewired the switches to get light
by day to prepare the amphibian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hired Tommy Larsen&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know the
truth at first. Then I saw Jeff was getting
suspicious, changed my plans and got a seaplane.
I even went with Atley to see my own
plan carried out,&rdquo; he screeched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;But everything went wrong. The life preserver
hid the gems. I knew that, and made
my sister run off with the wrong preserver,
that I took from Jeff&rsquo;s airplane. I thought
the right preserver was in the seaplane, but
Tommy was &lsquo;wise,&rsquo; and refused to do any more
than watch me, and when my sister came to get
the emeralds, he tried to prevent me from getting
away with it. You can piece out the rest.
You&rsquo;ll never punish me! You&rsquo;ll never&mdash;take
me alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eluding them, he dashed straight down to
where Jeff&rsquo;s amphibian, its prop still turning,
stood fifty feet from the end of the runway.
Tumbling into the cockpit, he threw the throttle
wide. Down the few feet the amphibian roared,
gathering speed.</p>
<p>The rend and crash, the tear of metal, wood
and fabric as the craft dashed against a tree,
was followed by a shrill scream from the stewardess.</p>
<p>In one thing the fanatic prophesied truly.
They did not take him alive. But still they did
not know where the emeralds were!</p>
<p>Next morning the Sky Patrol, the millionaire
and others took the train from camp to
the harbor.</p>
<p>But although Mimi showed which she thought
was the right belt&mdash;although they ripped apart
every life preserver on the yacht&mdash;no jewels
appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of every possible hiding
place,&rdquo; Sandy told his chums, &ldquo;and the only
thing I can see to do is&mdash;if they were in a life
preserver at all&mdash;what do you say to trying
this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He outlined a plan. So promising did it
seem that both Dick and Larry agreed to it.</p>
<p>That night an alarm of fire, red glow, yellow
and red flames, and suffocating smoke, terrified
everyone.</p>
<p>Tracing the smoke to the galley, Mr. Everdail
was astounded to find Dick and Larry
struggling with a man in pajamas&mdash;he had
rushed in, had seen&mdash;too late&mdash;the red flares,
colored fire powder and smoke pots that burned
in buckets, and had been unable to disguise the
fact that he had dragged two ice trays from
the refrigerator. They contained&mdash;green ice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live and breathe!&rdquo; cried Mr. Everdail,
inspecting a tray.</p>
<p>Quickly overpowered, their captive confessed.
The chef had taken the emeralds from the life
preserver and frozen them in ice cubes of a
deep emerald-green dye. These he easily preserved
during the short times the trays were
needed for other cubes, by putting them into
one of the deep vegetable trays used in the
refrigerating system.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>That was how the chums were misled the
night of Sandy&rsquo;s birthday party. The trays
had been emptied when they looked, and because
the trays had just been used for tinted
ice and were logically empty, they were fooled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was a coward&mdash;my conscience bothered
me,&rdquo; the chef admitted. &ldquo;I wanted to
return &rsquo;em, I wanted to take &rsquo;em. So, now&mdash;I&rsquo;m
glad I only kept them for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sky Patrol,&rdquo; said Jeff as the boys
pocketed their reward checks, &ldquo;the sole of that-there
right foot of mine itches. That means
I&rsquo;m to go into a new business and prosper&mdash;with
the help of my Sky Patrol and Ground
Crew. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop a signal flare,&rdquo; urged Sandy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
come a-flying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was settled!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
